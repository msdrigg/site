Environmental regulations and expenses for landfills and incinerators have increased significantly in recent years. In an effort to save time and money, many industries have turned to alternative methods of hazardous-waste disposal, including increased use of deep-well injection. In this method, wells are drilled into porous and permeable rock strata that are already saturated with salt water. Liquid wastes are then injected into the rock strata. Most of these wells are drilled to a depth of at least 300 meters—the minimum depth that generally puts the injected waste at a safe distance below any aquifer, in this case a rock stratum containing drinkable water. Such wells are rarely deeper than 1,800 meters, because below this depth it is more cost-effective to consider an alternative method of disposal. Deep-well injection, which has been used to some extent since the 1930s, has become a matter of controversy as growing numbers of communities come to rely on underground sources of drinking water. The controversy arises because there are three serious problems with this method of waste disposal.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Under the best conditions, wastes are injected into rock strata saturated with salt water and separated by impermeable rock strata from aquifers containing drinkable water. However, injection wells may leak, allowing significant amounts of noxious chemicals to mix with supplies of drinking water. In other cases, mistakes by personnel working on the wells may lead to the pollution of aquifers. In one such case, workers installing a 500-meter-deep well left a gap along approximately 30 meters of its steel casing. This allowed waste to escape at a depth of only 200 meters, threatening a regional aquifer supplying water to 100,000 people. Because such accidents take place deep within the earth, people may be exposed to dangerous levels of waste materials for long periods of time before the problem is even discovered.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The third problem associated with deep-well injection arises from the fact that it is nearly impossible to predict how the injected wastes will be acted on by the geological features of the injection area. Unlike surface water, the water in underground rock strata does not flow entirely under the influence of gravity. Moving along subterranean pressure gradients, it can flow in any direction and, in some cases, can be transported thousands of meters per year through geologic faults, porous rock, or other geologic formations.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The significant uncertainty about where injected wastes will flow, along with the possibilities of mechanical failure and human error, makes deep-well injection a risky means of managing hazardous wastes. Unfortunately, as societies produce more toxic waste, industry will rely increasingly upon this relatively cheap, efficient means of disposal.</p>",

Nope. This answer choice just conveys the idea that deep-well injection is popular. The author mentions this a few times (P1, S3; P4, S2), but the author was primarily concerned with showing why deep-well injection is dangerous. This answer choice doesn't even hint at the danger involved, so it cannot accurately state the main point. Moreover, there's a factual issue in this answer choice. The passage never states that deep-well injection has “wholly supplanted” (completely replaced) other waste disposal methods. The passage only states that the use of deep-well injection has recently “increased” (P1, S3; P4, S2). Either one of these issues is enough to sink (C)."

The claim that injecting waste at more than 1,800 meters is “more dangerous” than at 300 meters is consistent with that main point, so this answer choice may bear closer scrutiny. Checking the passage for the reference to 1,800 meters would lead us to the sixth and seventh sentences of the first paragraph. In those lines, the author says that injecting waste at less than 300 meters is more dangerous than injecting waste at more than 300 meters. The author also says that injecting waste more than 1,800 meters underground isn't cost-effective. So, this answer choice gets things backward. It is less dangerous but more expensive to deposit waste at 1,800 meters. So, checking the passage confirms that this answer choice is not correct."

Probably, since this was the general idea put forth by the third paragraph. If you cannot recall whether this claim is supported, we can consider whether it is consistent with the main point. The main point asserted that deep-well injection is dangerous due to mechanical failure, human errors, and the unpredictable flow of underground water. This answer choice is consistent with that main point — particularly the part about the unpredictable flow of underground water. Therefore, this answer choice warrants a closer look, even if we didn't remember reading about this specific idea. We can find the support in the third paragraph. There, the author says that underground water can sometimes “be transported thousands of meters per year through geologic faults, porous rock, or other geologic formations” (P3, S3). “Thousands of meters” would certainly qualify as a “great distance.” Therefore, this part of the passage supports the possibility that deep-well injection can contaminate drinking waters great distances from the injection site."

Environmental regulations and expenses for landfills and incinerators have increased significantly in recent years. In an effort to save time and money, many industries have turned to alternative methods of hazardous-waste disposal, including increased use of deep-well injection. In this method, wells are drilled into porous and permeable rock strata that are already saturated with salt water. Liquid wastes are then injected into the rock strata. Most of these wells are drilled to a depth of at least 300 meters—the minimum depth that generally puts the injected waste at a safe distance below any aquifer, in this case a rock stratum containing drinkable water. Such wells are rarely deeper than 1,800 meters, because below this depth it is more cost-effective to consider an alternative method of disposal.

There, the author explains that leakage from a well escaped at a “depth of only 200 meters,” which threatened “a regional aquifer supplying water to 100,000 people” (P2, S5).

Environmental regulations and expenses for landfills and incinerators have increased significantly in recent years. In an effort to save time and money, many industries have turned to alternative methods of hazardous-waste disposal, including increased use of deep-well injection. In this method, wells are drilled into porous and permeable rock strata that are already saturated with salt water. Liquid wastes are then injected into the rock strata. Most of these wells are drilled to a depth of at least 300 meters—the minimum depth that generally puts the injected waste at a safe distance below any aquifer, in this case a rock stratum containing drinkable water. Such wells are rarely deeper than 1,800 meters, because below this depth it is more cost-effective to consider an alternative method of disposal. Deep-well injection, which has been used to some extent since the 1930s, has become a matter of controversy as growing numbers of communities come to rely on underground sources of drinking water. The controversy arises because there are three serious problems with this method of waste disposal.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Under the best conditions, wastes are injected into rock strata saturated with salt water and separated by impermeable rock strata from aquifers containing drinkable water. However, injection wells may leak, allowing significant amounts of noxious chemicals to mix with supplies of drinking water. In other cases, mistakes by personnel working on the wells may lead to the pollution of aquifers. In one such case, workers installing a 500-meter-deep well left a gap along approximately 30 meters of its steel casing. This allowed waste to escape at a depth of only 200 meters, threatening a regional aquifer supplying water to 100,000 people. Because such accidents take place deep within the earth, people may be exposed to dangerous levels of waste materials for long periods of time before the problem is even discovered.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The third problem associated with deep-well injection arises from the fact that it is nearly impossible to predict how the injected wastes will be acted on by the geological features of the injection area. Unlike surface water, the water in underground rock strata does not flow entirely under the influence of gravity. Moving along subterranean pressure gradients, it can flow in any direction and, in some cases, can be transported thousands of meters per year through geologic faults, porous rock, or other geologic formations.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The significant uncertainty about where injected wastes will flow, along with the possibilities of mechanical failure and human error, makes deep-well injection a risky means of managing hazardous wastes. Unfortunately, as societies produce more toxic waste, industry will rely increasingly upon this relatively cheap, efficient means of disposal.</p>",

                        "stimulusText": "<p style='text-indent: 1em;'>A major problem facing industrial societies is their exponentially increasing production of toxic waste. Environmental regulations and expenses for landfills and incinerators have increased significantly in recent years. In an effort to save time and money, many industries have turned to alternative methods of hazardous-waste disposal, including increased use of deep-well injection. In this method, wells are drilled into porous and permeable rock strata that are already saturated with salt water. Liquid wastes are then injected into the rock strata. Most of these wells are drilled to a depth of at least 300 meters—the minimum depth that generally puts the injected waste at a safe distance below any aquifer, in this case a rock stratum containing drinkable water. Such wells are rarely deeper than 1,800 meters, because below this depth it is more cost-effective to consider an alternative method of disposal. Deep-well injection, which has been used to some extent since the 1930s, has become a matter of controversy as growing numbers of communities come to rely on underground sources of drinking water. The controversy arises because there are three serious problems with this method of waste disposal.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Under the best conditions, wastes are injected into rock strata saturated with salt water and separated by impermeable rock strata from aquifers containing drinkable water. However, injection wells may leak, allowing significant amounts of noxious chemicals to mix with supplies of drinking water. In other cases, mistakes by personnel working on the wells may lead to the pollution of aquifers. In one such case, workers installing a 500-meter-deep well left a gap along approximately 30 meters of its steel casing. This allowed waste to escape at a depth of only 200 meters, threatening a regional aquifer supplying water to 100,000 people. Because such accidents take place deep within the earth, people may be exposed to dangerous levels of waste materials for long periods of time before the problem is even discovered.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The third problem associated with deep-well injection arises from the fact that it is nearly impossible to predict how the injected wastes will be acted on by the geological features of the injection area. Unlike surface water, the water in underground rock strata does not flow entirely under the influence of gravity. Moving along subterranean pressure gradients, it can flow in any direction and, in some cases, can be transported thousands of meters per year through geologic faults, porous rock, or other geologic formations.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The significant uncertainty about where injected wastes will flow, along with the possibilities of mechanical failure and human error, makes deep-well injection a risky means of managing hazardous wastes. Unfortunately, as societies produce more toxic waste, industry will rely increasingly upon this relatively cheap, efficient means of disposal.</p>",

                        "stimulusText": "<p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Native American stories often feature a character called the trickster, a comic figure who has both mortal weaknesses and supernatural powers. Recently, the term \"trickster\" has also appeared in <lr data-itemid='13189-08'>criticism of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century European literature,</lr> particularly in reference to the picaresque novel and its central character, the picaro (Spanish for \"rogue\"): both the picaro and the trickster are heroes of episodic adventures, and both live on the peripheries of society and are morally flawed.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Yet closer examination reveals that applying the term \"trickster\" to both characters obscures essential differences between them. The picaro—typically a male character—operates primarily as an agent of satire. Most commonly, the picaro's adventures begin when he spontaneously yields to his own roguish, though innocent, impulses. The picaro indulges in vices and follies with relish and freedom, much to the outrage of other members of society, who often secretly indulge in similar pastimes out of a habitual compulsion. Thus the picaro's <lr data-itemid='13189-04'>authenticity</lr> serves as a foil to the perceived hypocrisy of conventional society. To such a society, the picaro can represent a dangerous, disruptive freedom, and it reacts by marginalizing him. It is in that distance—between the ostensibly disreputable freedom of the picaro and the hypocrisy of the safely ensconced social being—that the satire occurs.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>But the trickster, usually an animal acting as a human agent, does not serve a satiric function. For while the picaresque novel takes place in and satirizes human society, the trickster operates in the ahistorical world of myth; where the targets of the picaresque novel are the idiosyncrasies and inconsistencies of a historical human society, trickster stories seek, using the trickster's negative example, to instruct listeners about moral behavior of individuals. In fact, whatever flaws the trickster reveals are thoroughly the trickster's own. <lr data-itemid='13189-06'>They are not a foil to a corrupt society;</lr> they are instead essential to who the trickster is. The trickster is a comic figure precisely because of these somewhat irrational, compulsive, and foolish—in short, mortal—actions. Similarly, the trickster is a socially peripheral character not by being forced to the periphery by a hypocritical society, but rather because the trickster's thoroughly flawed character makes the trickster fundamentally antisocial, even anarchic, all the while helping listeners to avoid these flaws.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>It is this combination of mythic setting and mortal weakness that determines the particular targets of the trickster's comic high jinks: the eternal and unchanging foibles of mortal beings. In one story, for example, a coyote trickster falls in love with a star. The trickster is quite tenacious and human, even though the object of desire is beyond reasonable mortal possibility. In the end the star takes the trickster up into the sky, only to let the trickster fall back to Earth; the story's listeners realize that the trickster has gotten a comeuppance for reaching beyond proper limits, but all the while they recognize in themselves the trickster's extravagant hopes.</p>",

                        "stimulusText": "<p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Native American stories often feature a character called the trickster, a comic figure who has both mortal weaknesses and supernatural powers. Recently, the term \"trickster\" has also appeared in <lr data-itemid='13189-08'>criticism of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century European literature,</lr> particularly in reference to the picaresque novel and its central character, the picaro (Spanish for \"rogue\"): both the picaro and the trickster are heroes of episodic adventures, and both live on the peripheries of society and are morally flawed.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Yet closer examination reveals that applying the term \"trickster\" to both characters obscures essential differences between them. The picaro—typically a male character—operates primarily as an agent of satire. Most commonly, the picaro's adventures begin when he spontaneously yields to his own roguish, though innocent, impulses. The picaro indulges in vices and follies with relish and freedom, much to the outrage of other members of society, who often secretly indulge in similar pastimes out of a habitual compulsion. Thus the picaro's <lr data-itemid='13189-04'>authenticity</lr> serves as a foil to the perceived hypocrisy of conventional society. To such a society, the picaro can represent a dangerous, disruptive freedom, and it reacts by marginalizing him. It is in that distance—between the ostensibly disreputable freedom of the picaro and the hypocrisy of the safely ensconced social being—that the satire occurs.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>But the trickster, usually an animal acting as a human agent, does not serve a satiric function. For while the picaresque novel takes place in and satirizes human society, the trickster operates in the ahistorical world of myth; where the targets of the picaresque novel are the idiosyncrasies and inconsistencies of a historical human society, trickster stories seek, using the trickster's negative example, to instruct listeners about moral behavior of individuals. In fact, whatever flaws the trickster reveals are thoroughly the trickster's own. <lr data-itemid='13189-06'>They are not a foil to a corrupt society;</lr> they are instead essential to who the trickster is. The trickster is a comic figure precisely because of these somewhat irrational, compulsive, and foolish—in short, mortal—actions. Similarly, the trickster is a socially peripheral character not by being forced to the periphery by a hypocritical society, but rather because the trickster's thoroughly flawed character makes the trickster fundamentally antisocial, even anarchic, all the while helping listeners to avoid these flaws.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>It is this combination of mythic setting and mortal weakness that determines the particular targets of the trickster's comic high jinks: the eternal and unchanging foibles of mortal beings. In one story, for example, a coyote trickster falls in love with a star. The trickster is quite tenacious and human, even though the object of desire is beyond reasonable mortal possibility. In the end the star takes the trickster up into the sky, only to let the trickster fall back to Earth; the story's listeners realize that the trickster has gotten a comeuppance for reaching beyond proper limits, but all the while they recognize in themselves the trickster's extravagant hopes.</p>",

So, the passage doesn't even claim that these stories are written — they are probably oral stories. Technically, the critics couldn't read these stories if the stories were not written.) Assuming they have read trickster stories, it's a bit too strong to suggest that the critics' readings of the two are “at odds.” The critics note similarities between the two figures — similarities that even the author acknowledges are present (P3, S6).

                        "stimulusText": "<p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Native American stories often feature a character called the trickster, a comic figure who has both mortal weaknesses and supernatural powers. Recently, the term \"trickster\" has also appeared in <lr data-itemid='13189-08'>criticism of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century European literature,</lr> particularly in reference to the picaresque novel and its central character, the picaro (Spanish for \"rogue\"): both the picaro and the trickster are heroes of episodic adventures, and both live on the peripheries of society and are morally flawed.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Yet closer examination reveals that applying the term \"trickster\" to both characters obscures essential differences between them. The picaro—typically a male character—operates primarily as an agent of satire. Most commonly, the picaro's adventures begin when he spontaneously yields to his own roguish, though innocent, impulses. The picaro indulges in vices and follies with relish and freedom, much to the outrage of other members of society, who often secretly indulge in similar pastimes out of a habitual compulsion. Thus the picaro's <lr data-itemid='13189-04'>authenticity</lr> serves as a foil to the perceived hypocrisy of conventional society. To such a society, the picaro can represent a dangerous, disruptive freedom, and it reacts by marginalizing him. It is in that distance—between the ostensibly disreputable freedom of the picaro and the hypocrisy of the safely ensconced social being—that the satire occurs.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>But the trickster, usually an animal acting as a human agent, does not serve a satiric function. For while the picaresque novel takes place in and satirizes human society, the trickster operates in the ahistorical world of myth; where the targets of the picaresque novel are the idiosyncrasies and inconsistencies of a historical human society, trickster stories seek, using the trickster's negative example, to instruct listeners about moral behavior of individuals. In fact, whatever flaws the trickster reveals are thoroughly the trickster's own. <lr data-itemid='13189-06'>They are not a foil to a corrupt society;</lr> they are instead essential to who the trickster is. The trickster is a comic figure precisely because of these somewhat irrational, compulsive, and foolish—in short, mortal—actions. Similarly, the trickster is a socially peripheral character not by being forced to the periphery by a hypocritical society, but rather because the trickster's thoroughly flawed character makes the trickster fundamentally antisocial, even anarchic, all the while helping listeners to avoid these flaws.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>It is this combination of mythic setting and mortal weakness that determines the particular targets of the trickster's comic high jinks: the eternal and unchanging foibles of mortal beings. In one story, for example, a coyote trickster falls in love with a star. The trickster is quite tenacious and human, even though the object of desire is beyond reasonable mortal possibility. In the end the star takes the trickster up into the sky, only to let the trickster fall back to Earth; the story's listeners realize that the trickster has gotten a comeuppance for reaching beyond proper limits, but all the while they recognize in themselves the trickster's extravagant hopes.</p>",

Rosenthal tells us that her purpose is to \"question differences between plagiarism, imitation, adaptation, repetition, and originality.\" But such rhetorical questioning invariably leads to the required postmodern answer: that there is no difference between these things—other than that those in power use the opprobrious term \"plagiarism\" when the work in question emanates from those whom they dislike. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Though the book is animated by a <lr data-itemid='RQ001-04'>political fervor</lr> that is clearly moral, the author writes as if a political approach has to extirpate all moral considerations from any discussion of plagiarism. What in moral terms is a matter of honesty or dishonesty—plagiarism being dishonest—is instead reduced to \"the cultural location of the text and the position of the author.\" </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The consequence of a historical approach that seeks to \"delegitimize\" the distinction between imitation and plagiarism is that it demeans and degrades moral thought. That no moral standard is universal does not of itself entail that moral standards are nothing but expressions of power. Moral conventions, though not universal, may be valuable, indispensable, worthy of respect. The extirpation of moral considerations from political histories such as this one is a sad loss to political history.</p><p></p><p><em style='font-weight:bold; font-style:normal;'>Passage B</em></p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The idea of plagiarism, like all ideas, has a history. To earlier generations it had semantic inflections and resonances different from those we recognize today. The varied impulses behind these varying views—which have themselves evolved in response to commercial circumstances, new theories of artistic creation, and developments in copyright law—have repeatedly complicated judgments of plagiarism. Despite an abiding sense that plagiarism is morally wrong, there has been much fluidity in the way the charge has been applied, and virtually identical acts of illicit appropriation have been sometimes denounced, sometimes excused, and sometimes praised.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Christopher Ricks is suspicious of historical approaches to ethical issues; to him, emphasis on change across generations produces an extenuating moral relativism that shields the evil of plagiarism from its due obloquy. But there are historical approaches, and there are historical approaches. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Ricks is rightly dismissive of the postmodern reduction of moral standards to expressions of power. And it is also true that there has been some shoddy scholarship that anachronistically projects modern-day ideologies having to do with gender, race, or class onto historically remote controversies.

Absolutely! The author of passage A asserts that the failure to consider moral obligations in the context of plagiarism is a “sad loss to history” (PA, P3, S4). From this statement, we can infer that the author believes historical studies should include the moral dimension of plagiarism in their analyses. Now let's ask ourselves the same question for passage B. Did passage B's main point address how the moral dimension of plagiarism should be understood historically? Also yes! The author of passage B concludes that a historical study of plagiarism that doesn't impose today's moral standards onto the past can help us better understand our predecessors' views on plagiarism (PB, P3, S5). Upon review, the authors of both passages answer the question about how moral aspects of plagiarism should be understood historically. Therefore, we can confidently select this answer choice."

Rosenthal tells us that her purpose is to \"question differences between plagiarism, imitation, adaptation, repetition, and originality.\" But such rhetorical questioning invariably leads to the required postmodern answer: that there is no difference between these things—other than that those in power use the opprobrious term \"plagiarism\" when the work in question emanates from those whom they dislike. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Though the book is animated by a <lr data-itemid='RQ001-04'>political fervor</lr> that is clearly moral, the author writes as if a political approach has to extirpate all moral considerations from any discussion of plagiarism. What in moral terms is a matter of honesty or dishonesty—plagiarism being dishonest—is instead reduced to \"the cultural location of the text and the position of the author.\" </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The consequence of a historical approach that seeks to \"delegitimize\" the distinction between imitation and plagiarism is that it demeans and degrades moral thought. That no moral standard is universal does not of itself entail that moral standards are nothing but expressions of power. Moral conventions, though not universal, may be valuable, indispensable, worthy of respect. The extirpation of moral considerations from political histories such as this one is a sad loss to political history.</p><p></p><p><em style='font-weight:bold; font-style:normal;'>Passage B</em></p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The idea of plagiarism, like all ideas, has a history. To earlier generations it had semantic inflections and resonances different from those we recognize today. The varied impulses behind these varying views—which have themselves evolved in response to commercial circumstances, new theories of artistic creation, and developments in copyright law—have repeatedly complicated judgments of plagiarism. Despite an abiding sense that plagiarism is morally wrong, there has been much fluidity in the way the charge has been applied, and virtually identical acts of illicit appropriation have been sometimes denounced, sometimes excused, and sometimes praised.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Christopher Ricks is suspicious of historical approaches to ethical issues; to him, emphasis on change across generations produces an extenuating moral relativism that shields the evil of plagiarism from its due obloquy. But there are historical approaches, and there are historical approaches. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Ricks is rightly dismissive of the postmodern reduction of moral standards to expressions of power. And it is also true that there has been some shoddy scholarship that anachronistically projects modern-day ideologies having to do with gender, race, or class onto historically remote controversies. Yet bad history is no argument against history itself. To reconstruct the attitudes of the past is not necessarily to vindicate them. It is merely to acknowledge that whatever we might think is the correct way of apprehending plagiarism—and there is hardly a consensus on the matter even today—our predecessors may not, and often did not, share our perspectives.</p>",

Rosenthal tells us that her purpose is to \"question differences between plagiarism, imitation, adaptation, repetition, and originality.\" But such rhetorical questioning invariably leads to the required postmodern answer: that there is no difference between these things—other than that those in power use the opprobrious term \"plagiarism\" when the work in question emanates from those whom they dislike. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Though the book is animated by a <lr data-itemid='RQ001-04'>political fervor</lr> that is clearly moral, the author writes as if a political approach has to extirpate all moral considerations from any discussion of plagiarism. What in moral terms is a matter of honesty or dishonesty—plagiarism being dishonest—is instead reduced to \"the cultural location of the text and the position of the author.\" </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The consequence of a historical approach that seeks to \"delegitimize\" the distinction between imitation and plagiarism is that it demeans and degrades moral thought. That no moral standard is universal does not of itself entail that moral standards are nothing but expressions of power. Moral conventions, though not universal, may be valuable, indispensable, worthy of respect. The extirpation of moral considerations from political histories such as this one is a sad loss to political history.</p><p></p><p><em style='font-weight:bold; font-style:normal;'>Passage B</em></p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The idea of plagiarism, like all ideas, has a history. To earlier generations it had semantic inflections and resonances different from those we recognize today. The varied impulses behind these varying views—which have themselves evolved in response to commercial circumstances, new theories of artistic creation, and developments in copyright law—have repeatedly complicated judgments of plagiarism. Despite an abiding sense that plagiarism is morally wrong, there has been much fluidity in the way the charge has been applied, and virtually identical acts of illicit appropriation have been sometimes denounced, sometimes excused, and sometimes praised.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Christopher Ricks is suspicious of historical approaches to ethical issues; to him, emphasis on change across generations produces an extenuating moral relativism that shields the evil of plagiarism from its due obloquy. But there are historical approaches, and there are historical approaches. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Ricks is rightly dismissive of the postmodern reduction of moral standards to expressions of power. And it is also true that there has been some shoddy scholarship that anachronistically projects modern-day ideologies having to do with gender, race, or class onto historically remote controversies. Yet bad history is no argument against history itself. To reconstruct the attitudes of the past is not necessarily to vindicate them. It is merely to acknowledge that whatever we might think is the correct way of apprehending plagiarism—and there is hardly a consensus on the matter even today—our predecessors may not, and often did not, share our perspectives.</p>",

Not quite, although many test-takers are understandably attracted to this answer choice. There are at least two issues with this choice, however. First, the phrase “examine” is perhaps too neutral to convey the authors' critical attitudes. The author of passage A, especially, uses very opinionated language that expresses strong displeasure towards Rosenthal's postmodern, morally relativist approach. We typically don't use “examine” when we want to say “berate.” Second, neither passage addresses how scholarly attitudes toward plagiarism have shifted over time. That would require the passages to trace how scholars' views in, for example, the nineteenth century compared to scholars' views in the twentieth century. Although passage B briefly discusses how people generally felt about plagiarism in different eras (PB, P1, S1-2), passage B doesn't specify how scholars' attitudes have changed. And passage A confines the discussions to scholars' current attitudes toward plagiarism. So, we can't say these passages' central purpose is to examine scholars' shifting attitudes toward plagiarism."

However, passage B doesn't argue that a book is “deeply problematic.” For one, passage B mostly argues against Rick's view, which the introduction tells us is from an essay — not a book.

Rosenthal tells us that her purpose is to \"question differences between plagiarism, imitation, adaptation, repetition, and originality.\" But such rhetorical questioning invariably leads to the required postmodern answer: that there is no difference between these things—other than that those in power use the opprobrious term \"plagiarism\" when the work in question emanates from those whom they dislike. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Though the book is animated by a <lr data-itemid='RQ001-04'>political fervor</lr> that is clearly moral, the author writes as if a political approach has to extirpate all moral considerations from any discussion of plagiarism. What in moral terms is a matter of honesty or dishonesty—plagiarism being dishonest—is instead reduced to \"the cultural location of the text and the position of the author.\" </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The consequence of a historical approach that seeks to \"delegitimize\" the distinction between imitation and plagiarism is that it demeans and degrades moral thought. That no moral standard is universal does not of itself entail that moral standards are nothing but expressions of power. Moral conventions, though not universal, may be valuable, indispensable, worthy of respect. The extirpation of moral considerations from political histories such as this one is a sad loss to political history.</p><p></p><p><em style='font-weight:bold; font-style:normal;'>Passage B</em></p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The idea of plagiarism, like all ideas, has a history. To earlier generations it had semantic inflections and resonances different from those we recognize today. The varied impulses behind these varying views—which have themselves evolved in response to commercial circumstances, new theories of artistic creation, and developments in copyright law—have repeatedly complicated judgments of plagiarism. Despite an abiding sense that plagiarism is morally wrong, there has been much fluidity in the way the charge has been applied, and virtually identical acts of illicit appropriation have been sometimes denounced, sometimes excused, and sometimes praised.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Christopher Ricks is suspicious of historical approaches to ethical issues; to him, emphasis on change across generations produces an extenuating moral relativism that shields the evil of plagiarism from its due obloquy. But there are historical approaches, and there are historical approaches. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Ricks is rightly dismissive of the postmodern reduction of moral standards to expressions of power. And it is also true that there has been some shoddy scholarship that anachronistically projects modern-day ideologies having to do with gender, race, or class onto historically remote controversies. Yet bad history is no argument against history itself. To reconstruct the attitudes of the past is not necessarily to vindicate them. It is merely to acknowledge that whatever we might think is the correct way of apprehending plagiarism—and there is hardly a consensus on the matter even today—our predecessors may not, and often did not, share our perspectives.</p>",

                        "stimulusText": "<p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The use of criminal sanctions against corporations is well established, but the practice has recently come under fire from legal theorists who maintain that corporations should be held civilly rather than criminally liable for wrongdoing. Civil liability, these theorists argue, shares important features with criminal liability: both impose punishment on a company, both aim at deterrence, and both degrade a company's reputation. Yet, they claim, civil liability is better able to determine appropriate levels of damages. Furthermore, because criminal liability causes a greater loss of reputation, its overall cost to corporations is far higher than that of civil liability; this additional cost is borne by society at large in the form of higher product prices. Finally, civil liability is also more cost-effective from the point of view of the government: the greater procedural protections of criminal law make deterrence through criminal prosecution extremely expensive.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Even if it is less economical, however, criminal liability is a much stronger deterrent. The considerable enforcement powers involved, including the ability to detain and question corporate officials, are themselves significant deterrents. Furthermore, the fact that private civil litigation requires an identifiable victim with the necessary resources to commence litigation weakens its deterrent impact. Most importantly, the main function of criminal law is to censure wrongdoing and to emphasize that society forcefully rejects such conduct. Civil liability is ill suited for this purpose.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Other legal theorists who do not object to criminal sanctions per se argue that individuals within corporations, rather than corporations themselves, are the appropriate target of criminal prosecution in cases involving corporate wrongdoing. They maintain that individuals within corporations are more responsive to deterrence because they generally fear prosecution and the loss of employment that can result from it. Additionally, they say, punishment of a corporation, in the form of a fine, essentially punishes shareholders, creditors, employees who may be laid off, and ultimately the public, which is forced to absorb higher prices.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>However, this approach is also misguided. Corporations often bury responsibility within complex hierarchies, with the result that no individual responsible for corporate misdeeds can be identified. Another problem is that under this approach, a corporation will often find it cheaper to designate and compensate an internal scapegoat to face prosecution than to refrain from wrongdoing. The most effective way to ensure that corporations improve their practices is to hold corporations themselves criminally liable for their conduct. Indeed, criminal liability works on shareholders as well as corporate officers and employees: because criminal punishment of corporations decreases their wealth, it can motivate shareholders to push for better corporate practices. Arguments that shareholders and employees need economic protection are outweighed by the greater societal interest in ensuring the safety of employees, the public, and the environment.</p>",

                        "stimulusText": "<p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The use of criminal sanctions against corporations is well established, but the practice has recently come under fire from legal theorists who maintain that corporations should be held civilly rather than criminally liable for wrongdoing. Civil liability, these theorists argue, shares important features with criminal liability: both impose punishment on a company, both aim at deterrence, and both degrade a company's reputation. Yet, they claim, civil liability is better able to determine appropriate levels of damages. Furthermore, because criminal liability causes a greater loss of reputation, its overall cost to corporations is far higher than that of civil liability; this additional cost is borne by society at large in the form of higher product prices. Finally, civil liability is also more cost-effective from the point of view of the government: the greater procedural protections of criminal law make deterrence through criminal prosecution extremely expensive.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Even if it is less economical, however, criminal liability is a much stronger deterrent. The considerable enforcement powers involved, including the ability to detain and question corporate officials, are themselves significant deterrents. Furthermore, the fact that private civil litigation requires an identifiable victim with the necessary resources to commence litigation weakens its deterrent impact. Most importantly, the main function of criminal law is to censure wrongdoing and to emphasize that society forcefully rejects such conduct. Civil liability is ill suited for this purpose.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Other legal theorists who do not object to criminal sanctions per se argue that individuals within corporations, rather than corporations themselves, are the appropriate target of criminal prosecution in cases involving corporate wrongdoing. They maintain that individuals within corporations are more responsive to deterrence because they generally fear prosecution and the loss of employment that can result from it. Additionally, they say, punishment of a corporation, in the form of a fine, essentially punishes shareholders, creditors, employees who may be laid off, and ultimately the public, which is forced to absorb higher prices.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>However, this approach is also misguided. Corporations often bury responsibility within complex hierarchies, with the result that no individual responsible for corporate misdeeds can be identified. Another problem is that under this approach, a corporation will often find it cheaper to designate and compensate an internal scapegoat to face prosecution than to refrain from wrongdoing. The most effective way to ensure that corporations improve their practices is to hold corporations themselves criminally liable for their conduct. Indeed, criminal liability works on shareholders as well as corporate officers and employees: because criminal punishment of corporations decreases their wealth, it can motivate shareholders to push for better corporate practices. Arguments that shareholders and employees need economic protection are outweighed by the greater societal interest in ensuring the safety of employees, the public, and the environment.</p>",

It's not necessarily the author's belief. The author clearly believes deterrence is an important goal in both criminal and civil liability, as the author prefers criminal liability because it's more likely to deter corporate wrongdoing (P2, S1). However, the author claims the “main function of criminal law” is to “censure wrongdoing” (P2, S4) — in other words, to express society's disapproval of such acts.

For that reason, we can table or eliminate (D). If this answer choice appealed to you, we could research the passage. Reviewing the fourth paragraph, we'd see the author expressly disagrees with (D). The author says the “most effective” way to deter corporate wrongdoing is “to hold corporations themselves criminally liable” (P4, S4).

Civil liability, these theorists argue, shares important features with criminal liability: both impose punishment on a company, both aim at deterrence, and both degrade a company's reputation. Yet, they claim, civil liability is better able to determine appropriate levels of damages. Furthermore, because criminal liability causes a greater loss of reputation, its overall cost to corporations is far higher than that of civil liability; this additional cost is borne by society at large in the form of higher product prices. Finally, civil liability is also more cost-effective from the point of view of the government: the greater procedural protections of criminal law make deterrence through criminal prosecution extremely expensive.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Even if it is less economical, however, criminal liability is a much stronger deterrent. The considerable enforcement powers involved, including the ability to detain and question corporate officials, are themselves significant deterrents. Furthermore, the fact that private civil litigation requires an identifiable victim with the necessary resources to commence litigation weakens its deterrent impact. Most importantly, the main function of criminal law is to censure wrongdoing and to emphasize that society forcefully rejects such conduct. Civil liability is ill suited for this purpose.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Other legal theorists who do not object to criminal sanctions per se argue that individuals within corporations, rather than corporations themselves, are the appropriate target of criminal prosecution in cases involving corporate wrongdoing. They maintain that individuals within corporations are more responsive to deterrence because they generally fear prosecution and the loss of employment that can result from it. Additionally, they say, punishment of a corporation, in the form of a fine, essentially punishes shareholders, creditors, employees who may be laid off, and ultimately the public, which is forced to absorb higher prices.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>However, this approach is also misguided. Corporations often bury responsibility within complex hierarchies, with the result that no individual responsible for corporate misdeeds can be identified. Another problem is that under this approach, a corporation will often find it cheaper to designate and compensate an internal scapegoat to face prosecution than to refrain from wrongdoing. The most effective way to ensure that corporations improve their practices is to hold corporations themselves criminally liable for their conduct. Indeed, criminal liability works on shareholders as well as corporate officers and employees: because criminal punishment of corporations decreases their wealth, it can motivate shareholders to push for better corporate practices. Arguments that shareholders and employees need economic protection are outweighed by the greater societal interest in ensuring the safety of employees, the public, and the environment.</p>",

If we can't recall whether the author would agree with this, we should ask if we remember reading about the author's views on those who criticize the use of criminal sanctions. If you don't remember reading this, it's best to table this answer choice and move on to the next one. If you remember reading about this, we can review the passage to determine whether the author would agree with it. Since this asks about the author's views on those who criticize the use of criminal sanctions against corporations, the supporting text would have to be in the second paragraph. In that paragraph, the author never claims that the critics of criminal sanctions believe that corporate wrongdoing doesn't harm individuals. These critics didn't argue that corporate wrongdoing was victimless — they argued that criminal sanctions were too costly to society and the government (P1, S4-5). For this reason, we can't say the author would agree with (D)."

This doesn't conflict with the main point. If we can recall reading about this detail, we can review the passage to see if it's supported. In the second paragraph, the author says an identifiable victim must have the necessary resources to sue before civil litigation can be brought against a corporation (P2, S3). The author says this requirement “weakens” civil liability's ability to deter corporate wrongdoing. How could this requirement weaken deterrence? The must be many cases of corporate misconduct in which there isn't an identifiable victim, or the victims lack the resources to bring a civil suit. Therefore, the author almost certainly agrees with (E), making it the correct answer."

The author thinks pop music can express religious and political messages. That's definitely a non-entertainment purpose. Second, the answer choice must accurately express the same idea as the main conclusion. Does this answer choice get at the same idea as the conclusion? That pop music has been used to express religious and political messages? Also, yes! Although this is phrased in a much more general way than the argument, this answer choice describes a very similar idea as the argument's main conclusion. The argument's main conclusion asserts that some people who listen to pop music for entertainment value fail to recognize pop music's capacity to express religious and political messages. So the argument wants to convey the idea that pop music can be used for things other than pure entertainment. This passes both criteria for a Main Point answer choice and is therefore correct."

Some test-takers may pause over this answer choice since it appears that the president may use something akin to a “single fact that is incompatible with a claim.” If we assume the “claim” is Smith's proposal, that would make Smith's past use of bait-and-switch tactics the “single fact” referenced by this answer choice.

And that's because the president's argument isn't about what's an acceptable or unacceptable sales tactic. It's about whether we should accept Smith's proposal despite Smith's past inconsistent behavior. Perhaps this answer choice would be correct if the president's dismissal of Smith's proposal relied on an unsubstantiated claim that “bait-and-switch” tactics were legitimate, but that's not at all how this president supports the conclusion."

We expected that the correct answer would say, “If bovines are present in a region with no natural water sources, those bovines are domesticated.” This answer choice essentially provides the contrapositive of that anticipation, “If bovines weren't domesticated, they probably wouldn't be in a region without a natural source of water.” Since the contrapositive and original statements are logically equivalent, this answer choice strengthens the argument by linking those two concepts. It establishes that the bovines in this region of Africa are probably domesticated by the people living there. Moreover, the negation test will confirm that this answer choice is necessary to the argument. Suppose bovines could live in an area without a natural water source, even if they weren't domesticated. Would that weaken this argument? Absolutely. In that case, the bovines could be in the region for reasons other than domestication. Therefore, this answer choice is necessary to the argument and is correct."

Even if it's true that domesticating animals is one of the first things a group will do following its hunger-gatherer phase, that doesn't mean the group mentioned in the passage were hunter-gatherers or bovine-domesticators. There's a reason we want to connect these new ideas to premises. To strengthen the argument, we need to connect the new idea to something we know to be true (a premise). We don't know whether either of the two new ideas in the conclusion is true, so linking them together won't strengthen the argument."

However, this isn't necessary to the argument. Even if other large mammals couldn’t inhabit this region with human help, it would still be possible that bovines could. Perhaps bovines possess some unique characteristic that allows them to inhabit the land. Because this answer choice is not necessary to draw the conclusion, it is incorrect."

Instead, the sociologist said that each tradition—irrespective of its history—is essential to a culture's identity. Therefore, we must eliminate this answer choice."

We also know that moving the bears to the nearby island is the “only viable chance” of saving the bears. If moving the bears is the only viable way to prevent the bears' extinction, it is definitely the measure most likely to prevent their extinction.

If the people in the study all thought they were more adaptable, there's a chance the study did not include participants with the lowest cognitive plasticity. Without including those participants, it's difficult to draw any conclusions about people with less cognitive plasticity. So, this answer choice weakens the argument by suggesting that the study is flawed. (Now, just because the participants said they were more adaptable doesn't mean they are more adaptable.

Therefore, this would strengthen the argument if a premise asserted that the cost of transporting materials from Earth to Mars won't decrease. But no premises says that. The premise only asserts that the cost of transporting materials is “so high”—not that it won't decrease.

Not necessarily. Even if the costs of transporting materials through space decreased significantly, it could still be too high to make colonizing Mars economically feasible. (For instance, the transportation cost could drop from $100 billion per pound of material to $50 billion per pound of material, and it would still likely be cost-prohibitive.)

Even if other planets or moons could provide the materials, it might still be too costly to transport them through space. We could maybe travel from Earth to our moon or to Saturn to get the materials. But doing so would still require transporting the materials through space, which could still make it economically unfeasible to transport these materials to Mars.

Moreover, the negation test will confirm that this answer choice is necessary to the argument. Suppose Mars is a practical source of the basic materials required for establishing human habitations there. In that case, is the conclusion now untrue? Yep. If we can get the materials from Mars, we won't have to transport them there, and it may not be cost-prohibitive to establish colonies there. Therefore, this answer choice is necessary to the argument and is correct."

The premises were based on whether the patients “showed major improvement.” That's an objective fact, which can be corroborated through medical records.

If this answer choice were true, we'd at least be able to figure out how brightness correlates with which element the star is burning. But does this answer choice need to be true to draw the argument's conclusion? Let's turn to the negation test to check. Suppose it wasn't true that differences in the elements burning in any two stars in the same distant galaxy were detectable from Earth. Or, put another way, suppose that there were some stars in the same distant galaxy in which we couldn't detect differences in the elements burning. Would that weaken this conclusion? Not necessarily. This conclusion didn't assert we'd be able to determine how brightness correlates to every trait in every star in distant galaxies. Even if we couldn't observe differences in the elements burning in some stars, we may be able to observe this difference in most stars. And those observations would allow us to develop a general impression of how brightness correlates to elements burning. Moreover, even if we couldn't observe differences in the elements burning in some stars, we still may be able to detect other differences in these stars, and figure out how those differences correlate to brightness. Since negating this answer choice doesn't weaken this conclusion, this answer choice is not necessary and incorrect."

If you’re unable, or find yourself straining, to find something from the passage that aligns with a vague term, then there’s a good chance that the answer choice misdescribes the argument and is wrong. In this case, what are the “two phenomena” that conclusion claims are “associated”? The conclusion arguably describes Browning rainfall in June and Browning rainfall in September. Still, the author doesn’t claim these phenomena are “associated” — just that there's probably going to be more rainfall in June than September. Moreover, the premises never assert that there are many instances when both these phenomena are present (we’d probably have to bend the space-time continuum to get rain in June and September at the same time). Since we can’t fill in the vague terms from this answer choice with concrete details from the passage, this answer choice misdescribes the argument."

And, it's invalid for the same reason as the argument in the passage. If we take the contrapositive of the second statement (if Prefer History, then NOT Calculus Club), we can more easily see what a valid combination would look like.

Because the first rule is satisfied, we validly could conclude: Students -some- NOT Calculus Club. However, the stated conclusion (Calculus Club -some- NOT Students) reverses and negates both conditions. Although “some” statements are reversible, we cannot validly negate both conditions — in other words, we cannot validly take the “contrapositive” of a “some” statement.

This answer choice refers to “reasonable beliefs,” which is synonymous with “beliefs that are reasonable to maintain.” The first part of this answer choice says, “Among reasonable beliefs that are not self-evident.” This tells us these beliefs have two conditions: they're reasonable and NOT self-evident. If we were abbreviating this statement, we could write: Reasonable Beliefs & NOT Self-Evident. Next, the answer choice tells us that some of these beliefs “are not grounded in observable evidence.” If we were to add this to the above, we would get: Reasonable Beliefs & NOT Self-Evident -some- NO Observable Evidence. From the passage, we can validly conclude that there's at least one belief that is (1) reasonable, and (2) not self-evident, and (3) not grounded on observable evidence. Both our initial deduction and this answer choice express that idea. (It would be equally valid to say, “Among beliefs that are not self-evident, there are some that are reasonable and not grounded in observable evidence.”) So this answer choice must be true and is correct."

The author just chose Plato's Academy as one example. So, even with the strange phrasing, it's possible to determine that this accurately expresses the role played by the statement-in-question."

This strengthens the argument, as it shows that the theory-of-relativity explanation can stand on its own — it doesn't need a light-absorbing medium to explain star dimness. Moreover, the negation test will confirm that this answer choice is necessary to the argument. Suppose that the general theory of relativity depended on the existence of an invisible light-absorbing medium in outer space. In that case, is the conclusion now untrue? Yep. The professor's belief in the theory of relativity's ability to explain star dimness would be evidence in favor of the existence of a light-absorbing medium, not evidence against its existence. Therefore, this answer choice is necessary to the argument and is correct."

Some test-takers may take issue with the abstract phrasing here — especially that which doesn't conform to our anticipation, such as the words “psychological fact” and “reconcile.” However, if we can find an analog in the passage that matches these words, we can be confident that this answer choice accurately describes the technique of reasoning in the passage. So, what could be the “psychological fact” this answer choice references? According to this answer choice, the fact will help reconcile a “generalization” and “disconfirming evidence.” We've already identified the generalization as the belief that people gesture more when describing concrete stuff. And the disconfirming evidence would appear to be that this “correlation is far from universal” — not everyone gestures more when describing concrete stuff. What could this psychological fact be then? The last premise describes how some people “perceive” (a psychological phenomenon) words differently. In other words, the psychological fact is that the perception of particular concepts as concrete or abstract is not the same for everyone. So we can find an analog in the passage for “psychological fact,” which means we shouldn't reject (C) for using this term. For many test-takers, “reconcile” is another keyword that may jump out in this answer choice. Whenever the idea of “reconciling” comes up in Logical Reasoning, it usually means using evidence to show how apparently contradictory facts can both be true. That's what happened here. Yes, it seems contradictory to say that the generalization is (1) not universal and (2) real. But the “psychological fact” can show why both sides are true — we all gesture more on concrete stuff, we just disagree on what is concrete. So no matter how we slice it, (C) correctly describes the argumentative technique in this passage, and it is correct."

The sociologists certainly have issues with that. But even though they don't think popular support for a political party isn't entirely explained by that, they could still think that economic self-interest influences voters' decisions. The sociologists think that considerations of economic self-interest don't entirely cause the rise of political parties, not that those considerations never enter into the equation at all."

So this answer choice strengthens the claim that altering a single gene might cause harm, which weakens the scientist's claim that changing a single gene is too insignificant to increase the risk of harm. There are a few things that might give us pause about this answer choice. First, it's about plants we know to be toxic, while the passage focused on “foodstuffs,” which are generally not toxic. Second, it discusses the toxicity to animals, not necessarily humans. Finally, it just says that the “toxicity is known to be affected” — it doesn't say that the toxicity is increased. However, these doubts should be erased when we remember how strong the scientists' assertion was. The scientist depends entirely on the claim that changing a single gene is just too minor a change to affect a plant's capacity to cause harm when eaten. This answer choice shows an instance when changing a single gene can affect a plant's ability to cause harm. Even if those plants are not ones we eat or genetically modify, even if the change would only affect nonhuman animals, and even if the change actually makes the plan less toxic, the answer choice still weakens the scientist's argument. It undercuts the scientist's claim that altering a single gene “cannot have effects significant enough” to increase the risk of harm. This answer choice shows it's possible alter a single gene and produce significant effects, so it is correct."

But, it's not true that some historians are skeptical about the authenticity of the recently discovered tablets. So, the Sumerians may have been the first to create literature.” This doesn't make a lot of sense. There's still a big gap between the premises  — which about Egyptian tablets  — and the conclusion about Sumerian literature. Plus, what follows the “But” seems consistent with the premises that came before it, making the paragraph sound awkward. No matter which approach we used, we can confidently cross off (D)."

                                        "explanation": "This answer choice strengthens the argument. If the Sumerian civilization rose between 3300 and 3200 B.C., then it almost certainly didn't create literature that's older than the supposed literary writing on the Egyptian tablets. For this reason, some test-takers believe (E) is the correct answer. However, this answer choice isn't needed to draw the newspaper's conclusion. Even if the Sumerian civilization arose before 3300 B.C., it still could have created literature after the Egyptians. Perhaps the Sumerian civilization arose before 3400 B.C. but created literature in 3100 B.C. In that case, we could still conclude that the Sumerians may not have been the first to create literature. Finally, this is the argument we'd make if we used the backup plan: “We found some Egyptian clay tablets from 3300-3200 B.C. Some clay tablets appear to have literary writing. But, it's not true that the Sumerian civilization arose sometime between 3300 and 3200 B.C. So, the Sumerians may have been the first to create literature.” This doesn't sound like a valid argument. There's still a gap between the last premise — which tells us when the Sumerian civilization was formed — and the conclusion  — which tells us when the Sumerian civilization created literature. The Sumerian civilization could arose before 3300 B.C. and created literature older than the literary writing found on the Egyptian tablets. No matter which approach we use, we can confidently cross off (E)."

If grass and brush fires become uncontrollably large only when there's a lot of vegetation, we wouldn't expect grass and brush fires to cause a lot of damage during extended periods of drought. Common sense tells us there would not be much vegetation during an extended period of drought. So, during a prolonged drought, grass and brush fires wouldn't become uncontrollably large. Common sense also tells us that if these fires aren't uncontrollably large, they probably won't cause as much financial damage. (Yes, we're relying on common sense and outside knowledge, but that's OK on the LSAT  — even if you may have heard otherwise. In fact, Paradox questions are basically impossible to answer if you dogmatically follow the bad advice to “not rely on outside information.”) So, (C) resolves the paradox at hand, making it the correct answer."

To get a better sense of why this answer choice doesn't strengthen the argument, let's take the flipside of it. We'll translate it to, “If a dangerous surgical operation does not treat a more dangerous medical condition, the operation is not medically justified.” This doesn't strengthen the argument because we don't know whether the procedure to remove a polyp is more dangerous than the malignant polyp itself. If a premise established that it was, this answer choice would strengthen this argument. But without this key piece of information, we can't say that this would strengthen the argument. And without knowing whether removing polyps poses a greater danger than a malignant polyp, this information isn't necessary, either. Finally, this is the argument we'd make if we used the backup plan (note that we used the “if-then” translation of the answer choice and negated that statement): “Doctors can now detect polyps before they know whether the polyps are malignant. Doctors tend to remove these polyps. Removing polyps is dangerous. Some removed polyps are not dangerous. But, even if a dangerous surgical operation does not treat a more dangerous medical condition, the operation can still be medically justified. So, these dangerous operations may be medically necessary.” This doesn't make a lot of sense. We don't have any premises about a “more dangerous medical condition” or a “more dangerous medical operation,” so it's unclear how the “But” statement undermines what comes before it.

So, this answer choice establishes that some doctors perform dangerous but medically unnecessary operations when they remove nonmalignant tumors. This strengthens the researcher's argument, making us more confident that this new screening test prompts dangerous but medically unnecessary operations. We also need this information to conclude that the new screening test prompts dangerous but medically unnecessary operations. If removing nonmalignant polyps was always medically necessary, we'd have no evidence that doctors perform dangerous but medically unnecessary operations. So, we need to know that some of these operations on nonmalignant polyps are not medically necessary. We can also evaluate this answer choice using the backup plan.

Doctors tend to remove these polyps. Removing polyps is dangerous. Some removed polyps are not dangerous. But removing nonmalignant polyps is always medically necessary. So, these dangerous operations may be medically necessary.” This makes sense! Yes, we're removing nonmalignant polyps in a dangerous operation.

This doesn't strengthen the argument because the argument doesn't conclude that we should not use the new polyp screening test or that we should change the test. So, the “then” part of this answer choice is irrelevant to the conclusion. Plus, we don't know that these new screening tests encourage “medically unnecessary operations.” The researcher concludes that these operations are medically unnecessary. But this conclusion is flawed. The premises didn't tell us which kinds of operations are not medically necessary. Since we don't know whether these tests are medically unnecessary this answer choice might not even apply to the argument. Put another way, when an argument in a Strengthen or Weaken question concludes “X,” the correct answer won't begin with “If X.” The argument didn't prove that “X” is true, so the claim that begins “if X” is true won't add anything to the argument. Finally, this is the argument we'd make if we used the backup plan (note that we simplified and negated the answer choice to make the argument easier to read): “Doctors can now detect polyps before they know whether the polyps are malignant.

But, even if a new screening test encourages medically unnecessary operations, we can still use the test and not modify it. So, these dangerous operations may be medically necessary.” This doesn't make a lot of sense. The part about modifying or not using the test doesn't relate to anything that came before it, so it's unclear how the “But” statement contradicts the previous premises. And the “But” statement discusses medically unnecessary operations, so it doesn't provide good support to a conclusion about medically necessary operations.

However, that does not necessarily support the argument's conclusion that increased blood pressure while speaking results from the stress of speaking. Stress may increase one's blood pressure, but that doesn't mean people get stressed enough while speaking to have their blood pressure increase. This answer choice also doesn't strengthen the belief that increased blood pressure while speaking does not result from the physical exertion required to speak. Even if stress increases one's blood pressure, the physical act of speaking could increase one's blood pressure, too. So, this answer choice allows for the physical act of speaking to increase people's blood pressure. Finally, this answer choice states that there's a relationship between one's baseline blood pressure and the amount their blood pressure will increase. However, the argument doesn't compare people with low blood pressure to people with high blood pressure. It compares extroverts to introverts.

In a way, this answer choice resembles “same cause, same effect.” However, there are a few issues with this answer choice. First, even if introverts “often sense” that their blood pressure increases while speaking, it doesn't necessarily mean that their blood pressure is actually increasing. And even if their blood pressure is increasing, that doesn't mean their blood pressure is increasing because they're stressed. Their blood pressure might rise from the physical act of speaking or for some other reason. Additionally, this answer choice discusses introverts “who do not have chronically high blood pressure.” But the researcher's argument doesn't compare people with chronically high blood pressure to those with average or below-average blood pressure. It compares extroverts to introverts. So, it's unclear why information about introverts who don't have chronically high blood pressure is relevant to the researcher's argument."

                                        "explanation": "Many test-takers dismiss this answer choice out of hand, figuring that deaf people are irrelevant to the researcher's argument. But, before we do that, we should consider whether this argument presents one of the causal argument strengtheners we look for (elimination of an alternative cause; same cause, same effect; no cause, no effect). This tells us that deaf people experience increased blood pressure when they sign. Signing is how deaf people communicate, and we have no reason to believe that deaf people do not experience the same “psychological stress of communicating” that non-deaf people experience while speaking. So, if deaf people's blood pressure increases while experiencing the psychological stress of communicating, this answer choice presents an example of “same cause, same effect.” It affirms the relationship between the stress of communication and increased blood pressure. This answer choice also tells us that deaf people's blood pressure does not increase while moving their hands for other reasons. If a deaf person moves their hand for reasons other than signing, they're not experiencing the “psychological stress of communicating.” There's no stress and no corresponding increase in heart rate. Therefore, this answer choice also presents an example of “no cause, no effect.” If we take away the stress of communicating, we take away increased blood pressure. This last point is the most salient one. Remember, the researcher asserts that the physical exertion required to speak does not cause an increase in blood pressure. However, it would be difficult for the researcher to test that conclusion with people who communicate vocally. When these people speak, they will always feel the stress of communication and physically exert themselves. It would be hard for the researcher to isolate one of those variables with vocal communicators. But deaf people (or anyone else who communicates through non-vocal means) provide a way to isolate one of these variables. Deaf people do not experience the physical exertion required to speak. If their blood pressure still increases when they communicate, that suggests that the increase is due to the stress of communication and not the physical exertion required to speak. In a way, we can think of this answer choice as strengthening the researcher's anti-causal claim. In other words, the answer choice strengthens the argument by weakening the causal relationship between physical exertion and increased blood pressure. This answer choice provides an example of “effect without the cause”  — deaf people do not experience the physical exertion required to speak while communicating, but their blood pressure increases all the same."

But there are some ways a manufacturer could offer a warranty on a bad frying pan. Perhaps the warranty is extremely limited (e.g., the warranty only lasts for two days), preventing most consumers from taking advantage of the warranty. Or, perhaps the manufacturer knows that most people are too lazy or busy or just don't care enough to take advantage of a frying pan warranty. In that case, the manufacturer wouldn't have to reimburse all the customers who aren't happy with their frying pan. This answer choice strengthens the argument by eliminating one way a manufacturer could offer a warranty on a bad frying pan. It shows that most people would actually take advantage of the warranty if they weren't happy with their frying pans. The frying pan manufacturer would actually have to reimburse all the unhappy customers who purchased a frying pan with a warranty. That supports the author's belief that a manufacturer would not offer a warranty on a bad frying pan. Offering a warranty on a bad frying pan would mean that the manufacturer would “need to reimburse many customers,” and we know manufacturers wouldn't offer a warranty if they had to do that. So, a frying pan warranty seems like evidence of the frying pan's quality. You could also select (A) using the backup plan. This is the argument we'd construct if we used the backup plan (note that we simplified the premise, conclusion, and answer choice to make the argument easier to read): “If manufacturers thought a warranty would mean they'd have to reimburse many customers, they would not offer the warranty. Plus, most people who buy a frying pan with a warranty would seek reimbursement if they weren't happy with the frying pan. So, one should only buy frying pans with a warranty.” This makes some sense. The first sentence suggests that if manufacturers thought they'd have to reimburse many unhappy customers, they wouldn't offer a warranty. The second sentence adds that frying pan manufacturers would have to reimburse their customers if the customers weren't happy with their frying pan. The two sentences together suggest that frying pan manufacturers probably wouldn't offer a warranty on a frying pan that wouldn't satisfy their customers, which supports the last sentence's recommendation. No matter our approach, we can confidently select (A)."

This makes it sound like we may as well buy frying pans with warranties, right? A lot of test-makers think so. Unfortunately, this line of reasoning is incorrect. This answer choice doesn't tell us that frying pans with warranties will continue to work as well or better than frying pans without warranties. If frying pans without warranties last longer or perform better long-term, maybe we should buy those instead. Plus  — and this is the important takeaway point  — this answer choice doesn't address the argument's reasoning. It doesn't show how a manufacturer's warranty provides evidence that the manufacturer is willing to put its money where its proverbial mouth is to stand behind the quality. Instead, the answer choice just introduces a new fact that seems to directly support the conclusion (but, for the reason mentioned above, doesn't actually support the conclusion). The correct answers to some relatively easy Strengthen questions will add a new fact that directly supports the conclusion. But the correct answers on harder Strengthen questions  — the ones you might actually need our help on  — will almost never do that. Instead, the correct answer on harder Strengthen questions will address the argument's reasoning by fixing a problem with that reasoning. You could also eliminate (B) with the backup plan. This is the argument we'd construct if we used the backup plan (note that we simplified the premise, conclusion, and answer choice to make the argument easier to read): “If manufacturers thought a warranty would mean they'd have to reimburse many customers, they would not offer the warranty. Plus, frying pans with warranties work as well or better than frying pans without warranties at the time of purchase. So, one should only buy frying pans with a warranty.” This doesn't make a ton of sense. The claim that frying pans with warranties only work as well as warranty-less frying pans “at the time of purchase” does not provide strong evidence that warranties guarantee long-term quality. Plus, it doesn't relate to the first sentence's claim, which makes the argument sound disjointed and awkward. No matter which approach we use, we can confidently eliminate (B)."

No. Even if the warranties cover “full customer satisfaction” (whatever that means), that still doesn't address the argument's central flaw. The author thinks that a warranty will guarantee some level of frying pan quality since manufacturers wouldn't offer a warranty if they thought they'd have to reimburse a bunch of unhappy customers. But we don't know whether unhappy customers will actually take advantage of the warranty and seek reimbursement. If we knew that frying pan customers never took advantage of warranties, we could put a bad frying pan on the market and write whatever we wanted in the warranty. We could say, “If you are not 100% satisfied with your frying pan, we will not only give you a full refund, we will give you full ownership of this frying pan company in perpetuity.” Our warranty wouldn't show that we are 100% confident in our frying pan's quality. Our warranty would only show that we are 100% confident that our customers won't take advantage of the warranty.

In that case, jurors will find it harder to reach valid conclusions.

Sometimes, it's best to provide an example of what this flaw might look like so we can compare the passage's argument to an argument that actually commits the flaw described by this answer choice. Suppose the argument said this: “Lindsey: Several people claim that our company was unfair when it failed to give bonuses to the staff. Perhaps they recalled that the company had promised that if it increased its profits over last year's, the staff would all get bonuses. However, the company's profit wasfairly small this year. Clearly, then, the company acted fairly.” In this version of the argument, Lindsey confuses the size of a quantity (the company's profits) with the amount the quantity has increased (whether this year's profits increased over last year's). The company promised to give out bonuses if the annual profit increased this year. Even if this year's profits were “fairly small,” they still could have increased over last year's profits, and the staff could still be entitled to a bonus. However, in the real argument from the passage, Lindsey doesn't confuse the size of the company's profits with the amount the profits increased. Lindsey doesn't say that the profits were “small” this year. Lindsey establishes that the profits did not increase this year (“the company's profit was much smaller this year than it was last year”). So, this answer choice does not accurately describe an error in Lindsey's reasoning."

Denying bonuses to your staff isn't very generous, but this answer choice would support Lindsey's conclusion that the company's decision was fair. It's not a flaw to overlook information that further supports your argument!"

It's possible to argue that this answer choice resolves the paradox, but that requires at least a few assumptions. Suppose the statistics on deaths and injuries in areas without rescue squads dramatically undercount the number of deaths and injuries. And suppose that experienced mountain climbers are using these statistics to argue that removing rescue squads is required to reduce climber deaths and injuries. If both of these suppositions are true, then the paradox is resolved. The experienced climbers look at the statistics and see far fewer injuries and deaths in the areas without rescue squads. The experienced climbers then argue that we'd see fewer injuries and deaths elsewhere if the rescue squads stopped servicing those areas. Still, neither the passage nor the answer choices support these assumptions. The statistics on deaths and injuries in areas without rescue squads could actually overestimate the number of deaths and injuries in these areas. Experienced climbers don't have to base their opinions on these statistics. And the experienced climbers may not be this susceptible to flawed logic. Because this answer choice requires unsupported assumptions to resolve the paradox, it does not truly resolve the paradox."

If climbers know that rescue squads can save them if they get into a difficult situation on a mountain, they'll perceive the risk of that mountain as lower. This answer choice tells us that when mountain climbers perceive the risk as lower, more incompetent climbers will attempt to climb a mountain. This explains why experienced climbers think that reducing climber deaths and injuries requires abolishing rescue squads. If there are no more rescue squads, climbers will think that climbing a mountain poses a higher risk. If climbers perceive the risk as high, fewer incompetent climbers will attempt to climb a mountain. And if there are fewer incompetent climbers, we can reasonably expect fewer injuries and deaths on the mountains. Therefore, this answer choice is correct."

That seems a little confusing! However, let's go back to fundamentals. This answer choice uses the weak, wishy-washy language (“some”) we don't like on Weaken questions.

Maybe there's only like, one contradiction. That's not the end of the world. Especially because the historian concedes that medieval epistemology is a “complex” topic.

The “But” statement seemingly presents a downside of the previous claim. It shows that sometimes contradictory claims will become part of medieval epistemology. However, it's only a “some” statement. Saying that a definition “sometimes” produces confusing results is probably not the best reason to throw out the definition.  This isn't the worst answer choice in the world, and it's OK if we keep it as a contender. But this isn't a slam dunk. It features the type of wishy-washy language we want to avoid.

The historian's definition hinges on finding medieval epistemologists and figuring out their epistemological beliefs. This answer choice presents a reason why that definition isn't workable  — it's hard to tell who was a “medieval epistemologist.” It's possible, according to this answer choice, that no one was a medieval epistemologist! If either fact is true, the historian's definition is yet another definition of medieval epistemology that will not help us “determine what should and what should not be included in” medieval epistemology. Moreover, unlike other tempting answer choices like (D), this answer choice does not feature wishy-washy, weak language. That's another major asset for this answer choice; it should make us feel more comfortable eliminating (D) and selecting (E). Alternatively, if we used the backup plan, we could construct this argument (note that we simplified the premises and are using the negated form of the conclusion): “Until recently, intellectual historians didn't have a definition of medieval epistemology. We can define medieval epistemology as the epistemological beliefs medieval epistemologists hold. If we want to know whether medieval epistemology includes a belief, we'll ask whether any medieval epistemologists believe it. If they do, it's part of medieval epistemology. If any believe the opposite, the opposite claim is part of medieval epistemology. But, there's much debate as to which medieval thinks, if any, were epistemologists. So, we maybe shouldn't define medieval epistemology as the epistemological beliefs medieval epistemologists hold.” This argument sounds persuasive! The “But” statement presents a major downside of the previous claims. It shows that we may not be able to apply the historian's approach, as we won't be able to figure out “whether any medieval epistemologists” believe a claim. Whichever approach we use, we can confidently select (E)."

Yes, scientists could identify the drug-producing crops, but could they do so before those crops entered the food supply? Could they always identify these crops and prevent them from entering the food supply. After all, the consumer advocate didn't say that drugs will definitely enter into the food supply. The consumer advocate just said it “could happen.” Without knowing that scientists will always be able to identify the drug-producing crops and prevent them from entering the food supply, we can't say that (E) would weaken the conclusion that there's a “possibility” that drugs end up in the food supply. Alternatively, if we used the backup plan, we could construct this argument (note that we simplified the premises and answer choice and are using the negated form of the conclusion): “Scientists now genetically engineer some crops for pharmaceutical use. If pollen from a drug-producing crop drifts into another field, it can fertilize a food crop. The food crop would turn into a drug-producing crop. But, if a food crop would turn into a drug-producing crop, then scientists could identify the drug-producing crop. So, the drugs will not end up in the food supply.” This argument doesn't seem very persuasive! Knowing that scientists can identify drug-producing crops provides no assurance that the crops won't end up in the food supply. Whichever approach we use, we can eliminate (E)."
