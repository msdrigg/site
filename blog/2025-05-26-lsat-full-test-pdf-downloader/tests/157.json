Although racial segregation in the public schools had been outlawed in 1954, the ruling applied only to this one category of discriminatory practice in U.S. society. But it furthered within the African-American community the anticipation of broader changes. It was in this climate that the student sit-in demonstrations of the early 1960s were born. The technique of the sit-in was simple—African Americans occupying \"whites only\" seats in racially segregated establishments—but this new type of student activism galvanized established civil rights organizations, brought about the creation of new ones, and generated support for the civil rights movement among many new segments of the populace.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Initiated by four students of the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, the first sit-in occurred at a lunch counter in February 1960. Sit-ins then spread rapidly through the southern U.S., involving over 70,000 participants by August 1961. The sit-ins provided an important model for nonviolent protest and showed students that they could affect the political process. The influence of these demonstrations on the determination of the student activists was particularly visible in two events:  the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and the birth of a second form of sit-ins called Freedom Rides.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee followed the first sit-in by just a few months and not only solidified student involvement in the civil rights movement but also placed students in leadership roles for the first time. It operated independently of other civil rights organizations and relied on strong local leadership, helping to transform student involvement from participation in small-scale protests into a sustained effort to challenge discrimination throughout the U.S. But the development that marked the clearest turning point for the civil rights movement was the Freedom Rides. The goal of the rides, which were organized in 1961 by the already well-established Congress of Racial Equality, was to challenge segregation through the occupation of \"whites only\" seats on interstate buses and in facilities at the various terminals at which the buses stopped. Because the rides inspired violent reprisals in some regions, the U.S. government began using force to protect the safety of the Freedom Riders; this was the first government action taken explicitly in support of the cause of desegregation outside the public schools. The Freedom Rides thus helped take the civil rights movement to a new level by underscoring to the U.S. government, and to U.S. society generally, the harsh realities of the segregation system, and by providing, for students and their elders alike, examples of the methods they might use to achieve a more equal society.</p>",

The case didn't directly provide an example—it's not as if Chief Justice Warren and Thurgood Marshall showed students how to occupy segregated areas in Brown v. Board of Education. It's more accurate to say that the outlawing of segregated schools inspired African Americans to expect more changes and fight for those changes with techniques like the sit-in. So, we can eliminate this answer choice.

Not quite. The author implies that outlawing segregation in public schools eventually, indirectly led to sit-in demonstrations. It would be a stretch to say that outlawing segregation in public schools immediately “galvanized established U.S. civil rights organizations” or led to “the creation of new ones.” So, we can eliminate this answer choice. If we checked the passage, we'd see that the author says that the sit-ins, not the outlawing of segregated schools, “galvanized established civil rights organizations” and “brought about the creation of new ones” (P1, S5)."

Although racial segregation in the public schools had been outlawed in 1954, the ruling applied only to this one category of discriminatory practice in U.S. society. But it furthered within the African-American community the anticipation of broader changes. It was in this climate that the student sit-in demonstrations of the early 1960s were born. The technique of the sit-in was simple—African Americans occupying \"whites only\" seats in racially segregated establishments—but this new type of student activism galvanized established civil rights organizations, brought about the creation of new ones, and generated support for the civil rights movement among many new segments of the populace.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Initiated by four students of the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, the first sit-in occurred at a lunch counter in February 1960. Sit-ins then spread rapidly through the southern U.S., involving over 70,000 participants by August 1961. The sit-ins provided an important model for nonviolent protest and showed students that they could affect the political process. The influence of these demonstrations on the determination of the student activists was particularly visible in two events:  the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and the birth of a second form of sit-ins called Freedom Rides.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee followed the first sit-in by just a few months and not only solidified student involvement in the civil rights movement but also placed students in leadership roles for the first time. It operated independently of other civil rights organizations and relied on strong local leadership, helping to transform student involvement from participation in small-scale protests into a sustained effort to challenge discrimination throughout the U.S. But the development that marked the clearest turning point for the civil rights movement was the Freedom Rides. The goal of the rides, which were organized in 1961 by the already well-established Congress of Racial Equality, was to challenge segregation through the occupation of \"whites only\" seats on interstate buses and in facilities at the various terminals at which the buses stopped. Because the rides inspired violent reprisals in some regions, the U.S. government began using force to protect the safety of the Freedom Riders; this was the first government action taken explicitly in support of the cause of desegregation outside the public schools. The Freedom Rides thus helped take the civil rights movement to a new level by underscoring to the U.S. government, and to U.S. society generally, the harsh realities of the segregation system, and by providing, for students and their elders alike, examples of the methods they might use to achieve a more equal society.</p>",

Although racial segregation in the public schools had been outlawed in 1954, the ruling applied only to this one category of discriminatory practice in U.S. society. But it furthered within the African-American community the anticipation of broader changes. It was in this climate that the student sit-in demonstrations of the early 1960s were born. The technique of the sit-in was simple—African Americans occupying \"whites only\" seats in racially segregated establishments—but this new type of student activism galvanized established civil rights organizations, brought about the creation of new ones, and generated support for the civil rights movement among many new segments of the populace.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Initiated by four students of the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, the first sit-in occurred at a lunch counter in February 1960. Sit-ins then spread rapidly through the southern U.S., involving over 70,000 participants by August 1961. The sit-ins provided an important model for nonviolent protest and showed students that they could affect the political process. The influence of these demonstrations on the determination of the student activists was particularly visible in two events:  the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and the birth of a second form of sit-ins called Freedom Rides.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee followed the first sit-in by just a few months and not only solidified student involvement in the civil rights movement but also placed students in leadership roles for the first time. It operated independently of other civil rights organizations and relied on strong local leadership, helping to transform student involvement from participation in small-scale protests into a sustained effort to challenge discrimination throughout the U.S. But the development that marked the clearest turning point for the civil rights movement was the Freedom Rides. The goal of the rides, which were organized in 1961 by the already well-established Congress of Racial Equality, was to challenge segregation through the occupation of \"whites only\" seats on interstate buses and in facilities at the various terminals at which the buses stopped. Because the rides inspired violent reprisals in some regions, the U.S. government began using force to protect the safety of the Freedom Riders; this was the first government action taken explicitly in support of the cause of desegregation outside the public schools. The Freedom Rides thus helped take the civil rights movement to a new level by underscoring to the U.S. government, and to U.S. society generally, the harsh realities of the segregation system, and by providing, for students and their elders alike, examples of the methods they might use to achieve a more equal society.</p>",

They believe that in so doing they play an essential role in preventing a constantly changing language from falling into disarray. In contrast, descriptive grammarians are so called because they are content to describe the way language is actually used by members of a community. In their eyes, those who seek to preserve some forms of usage while preventing others from gaining a foothold are being unscientific and are, moreover, doomed to almost certain failure. Descriptivists point to numerous examples of usage that were once judged by prescriptivists to be incorrect but that over time and through continual use have come to be almost universally accepted. One example is the use of \"data\" as a singular noun in English:  prescriptivists have typically regarded the phrase \"the data is incomplete\" as ungrammatical, on the grounds that \"data\" is the plural of the Latin noun \"datum\" and should continue to be treated as a plural in English out of respect for the word's origins. Descriptivists argue that \"data,\" in addition to its use as a plural, has acquired a widespread use as a singular mass term, like \"water.\" It would be pointless, they say, to try to reverse this trend.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>This example illustrates the two main objections of descriptivists to prescriptivism. The first is the scientific objection:  the transformation of language is governed by laws not unlike the laws of nature, and those trying to hold back linguistic change might as well attempt to defy the law of gravity. The second is the egalitarian objection:  the prescriptivists are simply trying to impose their own linguistic practices, which are usually those of an educated and affluent elite, upon other members of society. The suggestion is that the attempted imposition is somehow immoral.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>With regard to the scientific objection, it should be noted that while many attempts to regulate language have failed, some have succeeded. Descriptivists may respond that in the latter cases the usages favored by prescriptivists were in accordance with the laws governing linguistic change and would have prevailed without their assistance. But this is in large measure an <lr data-itemid='16130-04'>article of faith. </lr> <lr data-itemid='16130-11'>In the end it must be acknowledged that the laws governing the transformation of language are not like the laws of physics. Language usage depends on choices made by individuals, who are subject to persuasion.</lr> In response to the egalitarian objection, prescriptivists point to the importance of standard language usage for the free exchange of ideas. Those to whom preservation of the standard is entrusted inevitably possess some of the attributes of an elite, but their aim is one of inclusion rather than exclusion.</p>",

Well, the author doesn't think that language is subject to natural laws. If we don't remember that excerpt from the previous question, it says so in our third paragraph notes (“language is not law-like). But this answer choice uses the strong, SCOTUS-y language (“can contribute nothing”) that we don't like in Author Agree answer choices. So, it's probably best to resist any temptation to check the passage, table (D), and check whether (E) presents a more easily supportable statement. However, if we did check the passage to see whether the author would agree with (D), we wouldn't find support for its strong, over-the-top language. The author says that “it must be acknowledged that the laws governing the transformation of language are not like the laws of physics” (P3, S4). But does that mean science can't play any role in proper usage? Even if language doesn't follow science-like laws, the author could still think that language can benefit from some scientific principles. Therefore, we can't definitively say that the author would agree with (D)."

Structurally, the author uses the claim that some attempts at regulating language have been successful to support the claim that “[l]anguage usage depends on choices made by individuals, who are subject to persuasion (P3, S1, S4). So, the author would also agree that the successful attempts to regulate language “are evidence that individuals will sometimes make linguistic choices in response to persuasion.” Therefore, we can definitively conclude that the author would agree with (E).

Besides, we wouldn't find any support for this claim if we re-read the entire passage. The passage doesn't discuss the scientific method at all."

Well, our main point and notes mention that the author doesn't think prescriptivism is “elitist,” despite the descriptivists' claim to the contrary. This at least touches on the topic of “egalitarian ideals.” That doesn't exactly imply that the prescriptivists believe descriptivists undermine their own egalitarian ideals, but it's not so far off. Moreover, this answer choice at least uses the weak, easy-to-support language (“may”) we like in Must Be True answer choices. We should probably table (C) without checking the passage, looking to see if any other answer choices are better reflected in our notes. But if we get to the end of the line and haven't found anything, we can review this one first. Upon review, we'll see that the author claims that “prescriptivists point to the importance of standard language usage for the free exchange of ideas,” which the author characterizes as a motive toward “inclusion rather than exclusion” (P3, S6-S7). So, the prescriptivists must view the “free exchange of ideas” as an inclusive, egalitarian ideal. The author also says that prescriptivists think that allowing language to deteriorate without rules—the descriptivist approach—will leave language in “disarray” (P1, S2). If the descriptivist approach leaves language in disarray, it would be harder for people to freely exchange their ideas—which, again, the prescriptivists view as an egalitarian ideal. That would mean that prescriptivists would probably agree that the descriptivists overlook how their approach can undermine their egalitarian ideals. So, (C) is supported, and we can select it."

None of these resources discuss whether prescriptivists think that the descriptivists overlook word's etymologies. Therefore, we can eliminate—or at least table—(D) and move on to the next answer choice without checking the passage. Many test-takers will recall the discussion of “data” in the first paragraph, which has been referenced in a couple of questions already. In that part of the passage, the author says that descriptivists know that “data” was originally just a plural noun but also argue that it, “in addition to its use as a plural, has acquired a widespread use as a singular mass term” (P1, S7). So, the one time the passage brings up a word's etymology, it's for a word in which the descriptivists are apparently aware that the word used to have a different meaning."

In fact, this answer choice doesn't even make sense. The prescriptivists want to correct people's language to keep language from deteriorating (P1, S1-S2). Prescriptivists imagine a better future with more correct language. How could empirical observations support the prescriptivists' view? What ... ahem ... data could we gather that would suggest that the prescriptivist view is correct?"

Well, our note for the second paragraph of passage A is, “Author on ocean exploration tech and legal agreement (allows governments to recover sunken objects, end unauthorized treasure hunting).” That suggests that governments retain a right to ships that sank long ago and haven't been recovered since. Therefore, it's worthwhile to check the passage to confirm that (A) is true. Reviewing the second paragraph, we'll notice that the author says that “governments often lack the money and skills to retrieve ... the government's treasure” (PA, P2, S2). The author also says that the agreement between the company and the British government could allow “nations to oversee the recovery of their lost fleets” (PA, P2, S3). The author says that the “treasure” and “fleets” are still the government's property. Of course, the relevant treasure and fleet have been underwater since 1694. So, governments can retain ownership of these vessels even though the vessels have been submerged for over 300 years. Therefore, it's fair to say that “a government's property rights” in a long sunken ship “are not forfeited merely by their not having salvaged the ship during the intervening time.” We can confidently select (A) and advance to the following question."

Well, our notes for the third paragraph mention “archaeological integrity,” so many test-takers may elect to check the passage to see whether (B) is supported. Reviewing the third paragraph, we'll see that the company that plans to recover the sunken treasure on the HMS Sussex—not the government—promises to maintain “archaeological integrity” (PA, P3, S3). So, there's nothing in the passage about governments being required to “ensure the archaeological integrity.” Moreover, if a promise to “ensure the archaeological integrity” has to be specified in an agreement, it doesn't seem like anyone is under a legal obligation to maintain archaeological integrity. We can cross off (B)."

Our notes mention that the company promises to “only sell coins” recovered from the expedition. But that doesn't mean that coins are not “archaeologically significant cultural property.” Moreover, this answer choice makes a bold prescriptive claim. These kinds of claims are hard to support and are thus unlikely to appear in the correct answer to a Must Be True question. For these reasons, we can eliminate—or at least table—(C) without checking the passage. If we had to check the passage to eliminate (C), we'd see that the author claims that the company and British government agreed that “cultural items have greater archaeological value than coins” and that the coins will be sold for the company to recoup their costs (PA, P3, S5). Even if cultural property has a “greater archaeological value than coins,” that does not mean the coins lack archaeological value. It also doesn't mean that the fact that the coins can be sold removes the archaeological value from the coins, as (C) implies."

Besides, we wouldn't find any reference to the “original owner” or their heirs if we re-read all of passage A. The author says the British government owns the HMS Sussex (PA, P1, S1). However, the author doesn't suggest that that ownership resulted from the original owner losing ownership in probate or anything like that."

This answer choice provides one reason why these coins may have less “archaeological value”—they're all identical, so there may not be a compelling reason to preserve all of them. This also works as a response to the draft provision against selling items. The answer choice states that some coins can be preserved for public display and scholarship in museums, while the other virtually identical coins—which wouldn't add much to the museum displays—can be sold. This response shows that selling recovered artifacts may not be fundamentally incompatible with the preservation of UCH. Since this answer choice passes both of those questions, we can select it and advance to the following question."

The agreement is a legal breakthrough that could allow the recovery of perhaps US$4 billion in gold coins lost with the <em style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sussex</em> in a storm in 1694.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>As robots, sonar, and other technologically advanced gear have opened the deepest oceans to exploration and recovery, governments have begun asserting ownership over their sunken vessels. But governments often lack the money and skills to retrieve cultural riches and, until now, there had been no legal precedent for a private company to join with a government to salvage the government's treasure. This agreement could end the days of freelance treasure hunting and allow nations to oversee the recovery of their lost fleets.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The company, which is funding the venture, agrees with British historians that the ship carried coins, most likely gold, worth £1 million in 1694. The US$4 billion figure is the coins' theoretical value if sold to collectors. The agreement calls for archaeological integrity—a difficult technical feat at such depths and a goal that critics of for-profit archaeology are likely to doubt. Many archaeologists abhor the sale of recovered artifacts, arguing that this inhibits scholarly analysis and public display. The agreement, however, draws a distinction between different classes of artifacts, recognizing that cultural items have greater archaeological value than coins, which it allows to be sold to help pay for the project.</p><p><em style='font-weight:bold; font-style:normal;'></p><p>Passage B</em></p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>\"Underwater cultural heritage\" (UCH) means all traces of human existence that have been partially, totally, or periodically situated underwater for at least 100 years.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>1.

These environmentalists argue that in a variety of ways the effort a nation must expend to pay its debt hastens the depletion of its natural resources, increases pollution, or hampers domestic spending. The most common reason given by the environmentalists is known as the exports promotion hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, in order to increase foreign trade in a way that better allows it to repay international debt, a nation must divert resources away from sectors generating domestic goods and toward the production of export goods. Partly because of the greater volume involved, this causes more environmental damage than does production of goods for domestic consumption. One possible scenario frequently cited by environmentalists is that a nation might raze its forests for timber or to open up land on which to plant cash crops. Another reason the environmentalists give for their claims is that domestic spending can fall when a nation shifts money toward repayment of its debt. A nation may take funds away from health care, education, or improvements in such public services as water quality or sanitation. It can also adjust its economy in other potentially harmful ways in order to cut costs—for example, through the elimination of government subsidies for practices that reduce pollution or conserve natural resources. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>But the evidence for the environmentalists' claims is weak. With respect to the exports promotion hypothesis, one recent study does suggest a positive correlation between international debt and deforestation, but also indicates that other factors besides debt may play a stronger role. Another study found only a slight positive correlation between debt and deforestation; in fact, in one nation the correlation was negative, contrary to the environmentalists' expectations. The impact of debt on environmental indicators such as pollution or depletion of other resources has not yet been studied. Similarly, with respect to the domestic spending argument, while debt-saddled nations might shift money away from programs designed to enhance quality of life, it is just as likely that they would shift the money from plans that, if implemented, would have a negative impact on the environment. For example, they might abandon plans to build new dams or roads, or eliminate subsidies that promote fertilizer or pesticide use. The extent, then, to which a <lr data-itemid='11589-04'>nation's quality of life</lr> is connected to the size of its international debt must be considered unknown. Indeed, a case could be made that at least some of the fiscal discipline or economic restructuring imposed by debt may rein in potentially harmful spending.</p>",

These environmentalists argue that in a variety of ways the effort a nation must expend to pay its debt hastens the depletion of its natural resources, increases pollution, or hampers domestic spending. The most common reason given by the environmentalists is known as the exports promotion hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, in order to increase foreign trade in a way that better allows it to repay international debt, a nation must divert resources away from sectors generating domestic goods and toward the production of export goods. Partly because of the greater volume involved, this causes more environmental damage than does production of goods for domestic consumption. One possible scenario frequently cited by environmentalists is that a nation might raze its forests for timber or to open up land on which to plant cash crops. Another reason the environmentalists give for their claims is that domestic spending can fall when a nation shifts money toward repayment of its debt. A nation may take funds away from health care, education, or improvements in such public services as water quality or sanitation. It can also adjust its economy in other potentially harmful ways in order to cut costs—for example, through the elimination of government subsidies for practices that reduce pollution or conserve natural resources. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>But the evidence for the environmentalists' claims is weak. With respect to the exports promotion hypothesis, one recent study does suggest a positive correlation between international debt and deforestation, but also indicates that other factors besides debt may play a stronger role. Another study found only a slight positive correlation between debt and deforestation; in fact, in one nation the correlation was negative, contrary to the environmentalists' expectations. The impact of debt on environmental indicators such as pollution or depletion of other resources has not yet been studied. Similarly, with respect to the domestic spending argument, while debt-saddled nations might shift money away from programs designed to enhance quality of life, it is just as likely that they would shift the money from plans that, if implemented, would have a negative impact on the environment. For example, they might abandon plans to build new dams or roads, or eliminate subsidies that promote fertilizer or pesticide use.

These environmentalists argue that in a variety of ways the effort a nation must expend to pay its debt hastens the depletion of its natural resources, increases pollution, or hampers domestic spending. The most common reason given by the environmentalists is known as the exports promotion hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, in order to increase foreign trade in a way that better allows it to repay international debt, a nation must divert resources away from sectors generating domestic goods and toward the production of export goods. Partly because of the greater volume involved, this causes more environmental damage than does production of goods for domestic consumption. One possible scenario frequently cited by environmentalists is that a nation might raze its forests for timber or to open up land on which to plant cash crops. Another reason the environmentalists give for their claims is that domestic spending can fall when a nation shifts money toward repayment of its debt. A nation may take funds away from health care, education, or improvements in such public services as water quality or sanitation. It can also adjust its economy in other potentially harmful ways in order to cut costs—for example, through the elimination of government subsidies for practices that reduce pollution or conserve natural resources. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>But the evidence for the environmentalists' claims is weak.

The impact of debt on environmental indicators such as pollution or depletion of other resources has not yet been studied. Similarly, with respect to the domestic spending argument, while debt-saddled nations might shift money away from programs designed to enhance quality of life, it is just as likely that they would shift the money from plans that, if implemented, would have a negative impact on the environment.

First, the author says that “a nation might raze its forests for timber or to open up land on which to plant cash crops” but that this is only a “possible scenario frequently cited by environmentalists” (P1, S6). So, it's not necessarily true that producing many export goods will result in razing forests for timber. Second, the author says that a nation may create timber by razing its forests.

These environmentalists argue that in a variety of ways the effort a nation must expend to pay its debt hastens the depletion of its natural resources, increases pollution, or hampers domestic spending. The most common reason given by the environmentalists is known as the exports promotion hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, in order to increase foreign trade in a way that better allows it to repay international debt, a nation must divert resources away from sectors generating domestic goods and toward the production of export goods. Partly because of the greater volume involved, this causes more environmental damage than does production of goods for domestic consumption. One possible scenario frequently cited by environmentalists is that a nation might raze its forests for timber or to open up land on which to plant cash crops. Another reason the environmentalists give for their claims is that domestic spending can fall when a nation shifts money toward repayment of its debt. A nation may take funds away from health care, education, or improvements in such public services as water quality or sanitation. It can also adjust its economy in other potentially harmful ways in order to cut costs—for example, through the elimination of government subsidies for practices that reduce pollution or conserve natural resources. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>But the evidence for the environmentalists' claims is weak. With respect to the exports promotion hypothesis, one recent study does suggest a positive correlation between international debt and deforestation, but also indicates that other factors besides debt may play a stronger role. Another study found only a slight positive correlation between debt and deforestation; in fact, in one nation the correlation was negative, contrary to the environmentalists' expectations. The impact of debt on environmental indicators such as pollution or depletion of other resources has not yet been studied. Similarly, with respect to the domestic spending argument, while debt-saddled nations might shift money away from programs designed to enhance quality of life, it is just as likely that they would shift the money from plans that, if implemented, would have a negative impact on the environment. For example, they might abandon plans to build new dams or roads, or eliminate subsidies that promote fertilizer or pesticide use.

                        "stimulusText": "<p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Some environmentalists claim that the higher the international debt a nation carries, the more likely it is that the quality of life in that nation will suffer. These environmentalists argue that in a variety of ways the effort a nation must expend to pay its debt hastens the depletion of its natural resources, increases pollution, or hampers domestic spending. The most common reason given by the environmentalists is known as the exports promotion hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, in order to increase foreign trade in a way that better allows it to repay international debt, a nation must divert resources away from sectors generating domestic goods and toward the production of export goods. Partly because of the greater volume involved, this causes more environmental damage than does production of goods for domestic consumption. One possible scenario frequently cited by environmentalists is that a nation might raze its forests for timber or to open up land on which to plant cash crops. Another reason the environmentalists give for their claims is that domestic spending can fall when a nation shifts money toward repayment of its debt. A nation may take funds away from health care, education, or improvements in such public services as water quality or sanitation. It can also adjust its economy in other potentially harmful ways in order to cut costs—for example, through the elimination of government subsidies for practices that reduce pollution or conserve natural resources. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>But the evidence for the environmentalists' claims is weak. With respect to the exports promotion hypothesis, one recent study does suggest a positive correlation between international debt and deforestation, but also indicates that other factors besides debt may play a stronger role. Another study found only a slight positive correlation between debt and deforestation; in fact, in one nation the correlation was negative, contrary to the environmentalists' expectations. The impact of debt on environmental indicators such as pollution or depletion of other resources has not yet been studied. Similarly, with respect to the domestic spending argument, while debt-saddled nations might shift money away from programs designed to enhance quality of life, it is just as likely that they would shift the money from plans that, if implemented, would have a negative impact on the environment. For example, they might abandon plans to build new dams or roads, or eliminate subsidies that promote fertilizer or pesticide use. The extent, then, to which a <lr data-itemid='11589-04'>nation's quality of life</lr> is connected to the size of its international debt must be considered unknown. Indeed, a case could be made that at least some of the fiscal discipline or economic restructuring imposed by debt may rein in potentially harmful spending.</p>",

We know that studies find that long-term use can decrease crop yields, but we don't know if any farmers are using these pesticides for a long time in a non-experimental setting. Perhaps the manufacturers only tell farmers to use the pesticides once, and the farmers use the pesticides for a long time anyway. But it's just as likely that the manufacturers don't instruct farmers to use the pesticides only once or that farmers don't use the pesticides for a long time. Since this conclusion can't be validly drawn from the facts, it doesn't work as the argument's conclusion."

If the pesticides gradually decrease crop yields in the long term, then farmers who continue to use the pesticides will not have as many crops to sell.

Since this answer choice is a conclusion we can validly draw from the premises, this functions as an appropriate conclusion to this argument."

It may be true that the country needs to diversify its own investments and that the country needs as many overseas investments as possible.

This answer choice essentially says that laws similar to those proposed by the economist are not perfect. But, such laws do not have to be perfect to achieve their intended effect.

It's easy to assume that the laws from two years ago are very similar to the laws the economist proposes and that the these laws did stimulate the country's economy (since the country continues to face economic issues now). However, neither assumption is warranted. The laws passed two years ago might differ greatly from the economist's proposed laws. Notice how this answer choice just says the past laws “placed some restrictions” on removing capital, while the economist's laws will make it “much more difficult” to remove capital. These laws might be too different to compare. Moreover, the laws from two years ago could have stimulated the economy. Perhaps the current economic issues appeared very recently."

The author reveals this belief when they assert that the twelve-month schedule will “ensure that students will not forget their schooling during their breaks.” This assumption isn't necessarily warranted. The psychological research the author relies on only shows that students forget what they learned during three-month breaks. It doesn't assert students don't forget what they learned during month-long breaks. Additionally, this unwarranted assumption strengthens the author's argument. If students only forget what they learn in the nine-month school schedule — and not in the twelve-month school schedule — then we have a compelling reason to believe that the twelve-month schedule is better at promoting academic learning.

If we know that honey slows the growth of bacteria while antibiotic ointments damage wound tissue and slow healing, it makes sense that wounds treated with honey heal faster than wounds treated with antibiotic ointments and wounds not treated with anything. Honey helps remove bacteria, while the other two methods either further damage the wound or have no effect on the bacteria in the wound.

From this information, we can validly conclude that the human species is at least 400,000 years old, as we know humans were in Europe 200,000 years ago. This answer choice wants us to use that information to conclude that humans occupied Europe much earlier than we assumed — perhaps humans were even in Europe 400,000 years ago. There are a few problems with this line of reasoning, however. First, it can't definitively use this information to conclude that humans occupied Europe 400,000 years ago. Humans could have evolved from their predecessors somewhere other than Europe. So, even if the human species is 400,000 years old, it may have taken humans a long time to migrate to Europe. Second, even if humans did occupy Europe 400,000 years ago, this would only weaken the argument. In that case, the wooden poles could belong to humans, not humans' predecessors."

Making “highly trained workers” the subject of the conclusion would represent a jarring shift in the argument's focus. It's probably true that highly trained workers have more purchasing power than less skilled workers (since highly skilled workers have more job security and, therefore, more dependable income and more access to credit). However, this answer choice still doesn't work as the argument's conclusion since the argument only uses highly trained workers to make a point about workers with little training."

It's true that these techniques “increase purchasing power for workers,” as workers can “buy goods that they previously would not have been able to afford.” It's also true that these techniques “undermine[ workers'] job security,” as the techniques make “workers with little training ... more vulnerable to elimination.” Since this answer choice is a conclusion we can validly draw from the premises and conforms to the point the premises appear to make, it functions as an appropriate conclusion to this argument."

It matches, “if you want a high A, use B,” with “income” standing in for “A” (rather than “tax refund”) and “invest heavily in the stock market” standing in for “B” (rather than “use a tax preparation service”). This matches the passage's conclusion, so we should examine the premises to see if they also match. The premises sound a lot like “A is, on average, higher for those who use B than for those who don't use B,” too. In this answer choice, we learn that those who invest heavily in the stock market (i.e., “use B”) have, on average, higher incomes (i.e., higher “As”) than those who do not invest (i.e., “do not use B”). So, this argument's premises and conclusion match the passage's. And, of course, this is the same causation flaw as the one committed in the passage. Just because people who invest in the stock market have higher incomes doesn't mean that investing causes their incomes to be higher. There could be another explanation for their higher incomes—people who invest could be more money-motivated than those who do not, so they pursue jobs with higher salaries. This parallels the causation flaw in the passage, so we can select (A) and advance to the following question."

Rather than saying, “if you want a high A, use B,” it says, “if you do A, use B.” So, rather than setting a goal that “B” can accomplish, this answer choice specifies a group to which “B” applies. So, this answer choice's conclusion doesn't imply a cause-and-effect relationship, unlike the passage. This is enough reason to eliminate (B) without reviewing the premises.

Since this matches the passage's conclusion, we should examine the premises to see if they also match. Once we review the rest of the argument, we'll see that it doesn't parallel the passage's flaw.

But—crucially—it's the only answer choice so far that brings up how “worthwhile” the filmmaker's documentaries are. So, this answer choice merits a closer examination. Upon review, we can see how this would strengthen the filmmaker's argument. If the filmmaker's subjects don't know where the cameras are and therefore act naturally, we can reasonably argue that these subjects are depicted fairly authentically. These subjects are definitely depicted more authentically than those subjects who speak directly to a camera. This principle would, therefore, establish that the filmmaker's documentaries—which depict their subjects more authentically—would be more worthwhile than other documentaries. Since this isn't a perfect match for our anticipation, we should probably review the remaining answer choice to confirm that it's wrong.

If employees of highly profitable corporations are given bonuses instead of being monitored, and these bonuses incentivize the employees to work hard, then it makes sense that these bonuses can save the corporation money. After all, these bonuses would replace managers' need to waste their valuable time by monitoring their employees while ensuring the employees continue to work hard. We also need to know this to draw the conclusion. If these bonuses didn't incentivize employees to work hard, then the bonuses might not save the company money. Managers would need to monitor the employees again (wasting their valuable time and costing the corporation money), or the corporation would not function properly (potentially losing money in the process). Since this answer choice strengthens and is needed to draw the conclusion, it is the correct answer. Alternatively, we can also evaluate this answer choice using the backup plan.

This answer choice strengthens the argument by establishing that expensive bonuses can incentivize employees to work hard even though they're not being monitored.

After all, the columnist uses evidence about what the subjects agree to before the study to conclude how they feel after they take the study. (Notice the shift in verb tense between the premise and conclusion. The premises say the subjects “filled out” the consent forms “prior to their participation in tests.” The conclusion says the test subjects may not “resent” being given placebos or ineffective medicines.) So, the columnist must believe that the subjects' attitudes do not change between filling out the forms and being given ineffective treatments. This assumption isn't necessarily warranted. People change their minds all the time. It would be very understandable and not at all surprising if a test subject given an ineffective treatment for a disease they're suffering from would change their mind and resent the treatment. Additionally, this unwarranted assumption strengthens the columnist's argument. If test subjects do not change their mind after filling out the consent form, they will continue to accept the risk of taking ineffective treatment even after being given an ineffective treatment. Therefore, those forms would cast doubt on the medical ethicists' claims that subjects resent being given ineffective medicine in these studies.

So, the argument isn't concerned with the cost the library poses—it's only concerned with whether an improved selection would meet residents' needs.

Secondly, even if the argument assumed that those innocuous everyday occurrences were harmful to society, that would undermine the notion that vagrancy might reduce criminal activity! Before vagrancy laws, everyday activity was harmful and legal. After vagrancy laws, everyday activity became harmful and illegal. That sounds like vagrancy laws increased crime to us!

For instance, vagrancy laws could increase criminal activity by, as this columnist says, reclassifying everyday occurrences into crimes. Separate and apart from this phenomenon, there could be a nationwide increase in shoplifting. Even without the vagrancy laws, there would still be this nationwide increase in shoplifting. Still, we could say that the vagrancy laws increase criminal activity, as they're adding to the number of crimes on top of the nationwide increase in shoplifting.

There's a big difference between the conclusion and the premise and premise/conclusion: the former discusses “criminal activity,” while the latter discusses “crime.” Those aren't necessarily the same thing. Increased criminal activity sounds like more people are out there committing crimes. There's more theft, vandalism, assaults, etc. But an increase in “crime” based on the reclassification of formerly legal, harmless activity? That doesn't sound like it's the same thing as an increase in “criminal activity.” If we reclassify harmless behavior as “crimes,” we won't necessarily see a spike in theft, vandalism, assault, etc. So, it's a problem that the author doesn't “adequately distinguish” these two things. The argument would be much more persuasive if it said, “The amount of criminal activity may stay the same under vagrancy laws, but vagrancy laws will increase the number of crimes committed.” Moreover, even if vagrancy laws increase the amount of crimes committed, it could still decrease the amount of criminal activity. Perhaps knowing they can get cited for violating vagrancy laws will compel “vagrants” from doing other crimes. If loitering is now illegal under vagrancy laws, perhaps people won't loiter or commit the other crimes they typically commit while loitering. That would reduce the amount of criminal activity, even if it increases the number of crimes. If you were relying on the backup plan for this question, here's the paragraph we'd read to test this answer choice: “Some people argue that vagrancy laws do not decrease criminal activity because vagrancy laws transform many harmless behaviors into crimes, therefore increasing crime. But, that argument does not adequately distinguish between an increase in criminal activity and the reclassification of certain occurrences as crimes. So, vagrancy laws might reduce criminal activity.” That paragraph makes sense. Yes, the number of crimes might increase once vagrancy laws reclassify previously legal behaviors as crimes. But that doesn't necessarily mean the amount of criminal activity will go up. Vagrancy laws might compel “vagrants” to engage in less criminal activity (like theft, vandalism, and assault), even if it adds to the number of crimes by reclassifying previously legal behavior as crimes. Whichever method we use, we can select (E) with confidence."

The conclusion is an “if-then” statement that puts the “people take a reasoned approach to getting what they want” in the “if” part of the premise. When strengthening an argument, we don't have to worry about making the “if” part come true. The conclusion is already assuming that the “if” part is true. In fact, we can treat the “if” part as a premise if that makes more sense to us. Rather than worrying about making the “if” part come true, we should focus on strengthening the “then” part. In this argument, that would involve showing that a reasoned approach to getting what you want involves not injuring other people. So, this answer choice, which only addresses whether governments can make the “if” part happen, does not strengthen the argument. (And, for what it's worth, this answer choice only makes the “if” part less likely to be true.) For that reason, we can cross (A) off. Alternatively, this is the argument we'd make if we used the backup plan (note that we're using the negated form of answer choice (A)): “Governments are supposed to prevent people who are trying to get what they want from injuring other people. But, governments alone can convince individuals to take a reasoned approach to getting what they want. So, even if most people take a reasoned approach to getting what they want, the government should not necessarily be less powerful.” This argument doesn't flow naturally. The first premise suggests that governments don't need to be powerful if people aren't injuring each other as they try to get what they want. The “But” part says governments can convince people to take a reasoned approach to getting what they want. That doesn't conflict with the previous sentence, as it seems to align with the government's purpose. So, the “But” makes the second sentence sound a bit awkward. Finally, the conclusion suggests that governments should maintain their power. But if people are reasonable while trying to get what they want, then governments don't need to fulfill their duty of convincing people to be reasonable, and governments probably should be less powerful. So, the conclusion doesn't seem to follow from the “But” statement, either. This means (A) does not pass the backup test. No matter which approach we use, we can confidently cross off (A)."

The theorist's conclusion doesn't address whether people actually can “promote their own welfare.” It doesn't say that people actually can get what they want. Instead, the theorist's conclusion only addresses whether the government's power should be reduced if most people take a “reasoned” approach to getting what they want. Whether people eventually get what they want doesn't matter as long as they don't hurt other people along the way. So, this answer choice, which suggests that people can get what they want even when the government keeps them from harming each other, is irrelevant to the argument. For this reason, we can cross off (B). Alternatively, this is the argument we'd make if we used the backup plan (note that we're using the negated form of answer choice (B)): “Governments are supposed to prevent people who are trying to get what they want from injuring other people. But, the government cannot serve its purpose without diminishing people's ability to promote their own welfare. So, even if most people take a reasoned approach to getting what they want, the government should not necessarily be less powerful.” This doesn't make a lot of sense. The “But” part suggests that the government gets in the way of people getting what they want. That sounds like a reason to reduce the government's power if you ask us. Especially if, as the “So” part says, most people are reasonable as they pursue what they want. These facts suggest that the government should have less power—not more, as the conclusion says. Since this conclusion doesn't follow logically, (B) doesn't pass the backup test. No matter our approach, we can confidently cross off (B)."

This answer choice strengthens the argument by establishing that taking a reasoned approach to getting what you want involves not injuring other people. If people who take a reasoned approach are less likely to injure other people, then the government will have less work to do. After all, the government's purpose is just to stop people from hurting each other as the people pursue their wants. If most people take a reasoned approach, the government will have much less work to do, and its powers should probably be reduced. We also need to know this to draw the conclusion. If people who take a reasoned approach to pursuing their wants hurt others in the process, then the government would have a lot of work to do, even if most people take a reasoned approach. The government would need power to stop people from hurting each other as they pursued their wants. Therefore, if this answer choice weren't true, we couldn't draw this conclusion. That proves that this answer choice is necessary to this argument. Alternatively, we can also evaluate this answer choice using the backup plan. Here's the argument we'd make if we used the backup plan (note that we negated and simplified this answer choice to make this easier to read): “Governments are supposed to prevent people who are trying to get what they want from injuring other people. But, people who take a reasoned approach to getting what they want are just as likely to injure other people as those who do not. So, even if most people take a reasoned approach to getting what they want, the government should not necessarily be less powerful.” This makes sense. If people who take a reasoned approach to getting what they want are just as likely to hurt other people, then the government will need to maintain its power to stop these people from hurting others. Since this argument makes sense, (C) passes the backup test. Therefore, no matter which approach we used, we can be confident that (C) is the correct answer. "

This answer choice doesn't strengthen the argument because it makes it more likely that people will injure each other as they pursue their wants. If (D) is true, even if just a few people start injuring others, it'll eventually lead to other people injuring them as others pursue their wants. (D) would create a cascading effect, where more and more people injure each other as they pursue their wants. This would require more government intervention, not less. So, this answer choice weakens the theorist's conclusion by showing how more government power might be needed to prevent people from injuring others. Alternatively, this is the argument we'd make if we used the backup plan (note that we're using the negated form of answer choice (D)): “Governments are supposed to prevent people who are trying to get what they want from injuring other people.

So, even if most people take a reasoned approach to getting what they want, the government should not necessarily be less powerful.” This argument doesn't make sense. The “But” part tells us that injuring others won't lead to more harmful behavior. That suggests that the government doesn't need to do much to prevent people from injuring each other as they pursue their wants. But the conclusion says that even if people are being reasonable as they pursue their wants, the government might need more power. That doesn't follow. The “But” part made it seem like the government doesn't need to do much when a person injures others. So, why would the government need more power when people are being reasonable?

But we're just going to say it: if this is the correct answer, this is a poorly written question. The anarchist indeed establishes anarchy and totalitarianism as the only available political alternatives. However, the anarchist does this as a premise. On Errors in Reasoning questions, we're supposed to accept the premises as true. We're supposed to analyze why those premises aren't enough to prove that the conclusion or a premise/conclusion is true. Every other Errors in Reasoning question plays by this rule (save one other poorly written question from an early LSAT), so we're not sure why this question doesn't follow this well-established convention. If the anarchist supported the claim that “People can either fight for anarchy or they can tolerate totalitarian government control” with another premise, (E) would be an unproblematic answer. But since that claim is clearly just a premise, this answer choice doesn't describe a flaw in the argument's reasoning. So, the moral of the story is that the people who make the LSAT are human, and sometimes they make mistakes. This question is one of those mistakes. It doesn't surprise us that this question was released as the “experimental” section of a Prep Test. We don't think this question would show up on a real section that counted toward your final score. More than anything, don't get the wrong idea from this question. Trying to look for answer choices that say “maybe the premise isn't true” will be a waste of time on other Errors in Reasoning questions. If you got this question correct, that's great. That means you understand how to eliminate answer choices that misdescribe the argument on an Errors in Reasoning question. That's a vital skill. But if you got this question wrong because you thought (E) argues with a premise, don't sweat it. That's the right instinct to have on Errors in Reasoning questions."

A star being nominated for an award doesn't mean that the star receives the award.

If we did translate this answer choice's argument, here's what we'd get: P1: if Big budget, then Heavily promoted P2: if Heavily promoted, then Released all over P3: Big budget. Conclusion: Released all over. Unlike the argument in the passage, this argument is valid. If we connect P1 and P2, we can reach the conclusion “if Big budget, then Released all over.” Because the film has a big budget, we can validly conclude that it will be released all over the country at once.

The conclusion asserts that drinking more coffee than usual “impairs” overall management ability. That's a relative claim—drinking excess coffee decreased each manager's ability from where it started. So, it doesn't matter that the managers' abilities weren't all the same. It's perfectly acceptable if some managers' abilities had different starting points or if coffee affected some managers more than others. As long as drinking excess coffee made their abilities worse, the psychologist can still draw the conclusion. Alternatively, this is the argument we'd make if we used the backup plan (note that we're using a negated and simplified form of answer choice (A)): “A study gave coffee-drinking managers even more coffee. The managers processed information faster but had trouble incorporating it with past information. Successful management depends more on incorporating new information than speed. But, the managers did not differ in their speed or ability to incorporate new information. So, the study doesn't prove that drinking more coffee than usual decreases overall management ability.” This argument doesn't make much sense. The “But” part doesn't really conflict with the previous claims that the managers processed information faster but had trouble incorporating it with past information. Rather than contrasting with that evidence, the “But” part just adds to the information. The managers got faster but had trouble incorporating new information ... and now their speeds and ability to incorporate information are all the same. The “But” part should form a natural contrast with the previous statements if an answer choice is going to pass the backup test. Moreover, the “But” part doesn't show that drinking more coffee improves overall management ability. If the managers are now all worse at an important part of their job, it seems more reasonable to conclude that drinking more coffee decreases overall management ability.

After all, even if drinking less coffee than usual was just as bad as drinking more coffee than usual, it could still be true that drinking more coffee than usual impairs one's managerial abilities.

If there are no factors more important to management than speed and incorporating new information—and incorporating new information is more important than speed—then it seems much more likely that making managers worse at incorporating new information means that drinking excess coffee decreases overall management ability. But the next question is whether this information is necessary to the argument. And this answer choice uses a SCOTUS-y phrase—the superlative “no other factor more important .... than“—that we don't like to see in a Strengthen with Necessary Premise answer choice. And that phrase makes this answer choice a bit too boldly worded to present a necessary piece of information. Even if there are factors more important to business management than speed and incorporating new information, this psychologist could still draw this conclusion. Let's suppose that the most important factor in successful business management is always starting an email with “I hope this email finds you well.” Incorporating new information and speed are the second and third most important factors, respectively. Let's also suppose that drinking too much coffee didn't impair any manager's ability to start emails with “I hope this email finds you well.” In that case, the excess coffee would still make the managers worse at management, even if it didn't affect the most important part of their job. The excess coffee would still make them worse at the second most important factor. After all, the issue isn't whether speed and incorporating new information are the most important skills. The issue is whether decreasing their ability to incorporate new information is enough to guarantee that overall management ability is worse. We don't need to know that incorporating new information is the most important factor. We just need to know that excess coffee didn't improve enough other factors to outweigh its detrimental effect on incorporating new information. And this answer choice doesn't tell us that. Alternatively, we can also evaluate this answer choice using the backup plan. Here's the argument we'd make if we used the backup plan (note that we negated and simplified this answer choice to make this easier to read): “A study gave coffee-drinking managers even more coffee. The managers processed information faster but had trouble incorporating it with past information. Successful management depends more on incorporating new information than speed. But, there may be factors more important to management than speed and incorporating new information and speed. So, the study doesn't prove that drinking more coffee than usual decreases overall management ability.” This, admittedly, doesn't sound bad. However, it still runs up against the problem we identified earlier in this answer choice's explanation. Even if there might be more important factors, we don't know how excess coffee affects those factors. If excess coffee might harm those factors, the study may still prove that drinking more coffee than usual decreases management ability. Therefore, no matter which approach we used, we can eliminate (C)."

This answer choice strengthens the argument by showing that excess coffee's benefits don't outweigh the harm done by decreasing one's ability to integrate old and new information. This definitely strengthens the argument, as it shows that any benefits that excess coffee may bring to the table will still be negated by the reduced ability to integrate new and old information. This will help the psychologist draw the conclusion that excess coffee impairs overall management ability. This is also necessary to the argument. If drinking more coffee than usual had benefits that outweighed the reduced ability to incorporate new information, then the psychologist couldn't conclude that excess coffee impairs overall management ability. In that case, the psychologist would have to conclude that excess coffee improves management ability. So, the psychologist needs this answer choice to be true to draw their conclusion. Alternatively, this is the argument we'd make if we used the backup plan (note that we're using the negated and simplified version of answer choice (D)): “A study gave coffee-drinking managers even more coffee. The managers processed information faster but had trouble incorporating it with past information. Successful management depends more on incorporating new information than speed.

So, the study doesn't prove that drinking more coffee than usual decreases overall management ability.” This argument makes sense! The “But” part forms a clear contrast with the information that came before it, and the conclusion follows naturally from the “But” part. Yes, excess coffee harmed the managers' ability to incorporate information. Buuuuuut, excess coffee's benefits outweighed that downside. So, excess coffee may not decrease overall management ability. This argument sounds like a well-written, cogent paragraph. So, (D) passes the backup test. No matter our approach, we can confidently select (D). "

This answer choice doesn't strengthen because it doesn't tell us about coffee's effect on incorporating information or any other factor related to management ability.

So, this answer choice doesn't tell us whether excess coffee produces other benefits that outweigh its harmful effects. Without knowing that excess coffee doesn't produce other benefits, we can't convincingly argue that excess coffee harms overall management ability.

The last sentence shows one instance in which that's true. We only have one word for “joy,” but it doesn't distinguish between long-term joy, short-term joy, ecstatic joy, or any other kind of joy. Finally, the last sentence supports the main conclusion.

If you need more reasons to feel confident eliminating (E), we'll need to work through this answer choice's referential language. The last sentence isn't really an “explanation.” Explanations are typically general claims. The last sentence is explicitly framed as a specific example. Even if we ignore that issue, it's unclear what the word “phenomenon” would refer to in this argument. The claim that “the words we use for emotions only refer to general feelings like excitement, calm, and joy”? In that case, the last sentence doesn't explain why that is the case. It just gives an example of a word that only refers to a generalized feeling. Does phenomenon instead refer to the claim that “emotions only seem nonrational”? In that case, the last sentence still doesn't explain why that's the case. Maybe the third sentence does, but not the last sentence.

In that case, it wouldn't be a “problem” that superstring theory cannot account for why the force of gravity is not stronger or weaker than it is! So, we can confidently conclude that the author must believe that (E) is true."

This matches the Kirkland conclusion that “a higher percentage of Bs than As are C.” Like the passage, this is a valid argument.

Still, this answer choice has a major red flag: the weak, wiggly word “some.” We don't like that language in Weaken questions. Such weak claims rarely provide enough information to meaningfully change the argument. Therefore, these answer choices rarely weaken the argument in question. Even if “some” of the subjects from the placebo group ate foods rich in vitamin C, those few subjects could have been among those who knew which pill they were getting. The author completely ignores those subjects when drawing the conclusion. So, this answer choice may not change the argument at all. Also, this answer choice doesn't tell us about the diets of other subjects. Perhaps all the subjects—irrespective of their group—ate foods rich in vitamin C.

Gordy's entrepreneurial skills and his belief in economic independence played a great role in Motown's success, as did <lr data-itemid='16815-04'>the artistic situation</lr> in Detroit in the 1960s. Capitalizing on the rich musical talent of Detroit's African American community, Motown moved quickly into the vanguard of the popular music industry.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Motown's status as an independent company allowed Gordy considerable freedom to oppose recording industry convention. He rejected the practice that was common in the late 1950s and early 1960s of having established recording stars remake songs originally produced within and for limited markets. Gordy insisted that the musical performances recorded by Motown artists would appeal not just to African American audiences, but to a much wider market, and that there would thus be no need to engage high-priced major-label artists to produce alternate versions of Motown's songs. Gordy believed that maintaining the highest possible technical quality in Motown's recordings was an essential part of this appeal, and he devoted the necessary resources to this endeavor.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Another crucial factor in Motown's success was Detroit's well-developed public school music-education program, which provided the company with a deep and talented pool of artists and technicians. The roots of this program reached back to the turn of the century, when a trained soprano and Detroit native named E. Azalia Hackley adopted the musical education of African American youth as her personal mission. From Hackley's tutelage to that of locally renowned public school music teachers, Detroit's African American youth had been educated in a vibrant musical atmosphere. Nearly all of Motown's session musicians, arrangers, and producers were trained in this program. Moreover, many of the performers who would become famous exemplars of the Motown sound received musical training and exposure to diverse musical styles in Detroit schools. Motown's three major early groups—the Supremes, the Temptations, and the Miracles—came together and originally rehearsed at their high schools.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>In addition to Gordy's business acumen and the talent produced by the local school system, the invention and growing popularity of electric instruments also played a noteworthy role in Motown's rise to prominence. African American musicians were among the first to use the electric bass, for example, crafting a distinctive sound that inspired other musicians to experiment with this new musical technology. This experimentation ultimately led to a revolution in popular music, helping to broaden both its sound and its audience. In this way, too, Motown Records helped to initiate, and simultaneously benefited from, landmark shifts in popular music culture.</p>",

However, Motown's success is the phenomenon, and the author only identifies Gordy as one factor that contributed to Motown's success. That one problem is serious — and would probably lead to quick elimination from an experienced test-taker — but there are other issues as well. There's nothing in this passage to suggest that Gordy's credit is “long overdue,” and the revolution discussed in the final paragraph was caused by musicians' embrace of electric instruments, not Gordy."

Rather than elaborate on all three parts of the explanation, this answer choice compresses them to “the efforts of an entrepreneurial individual in a favorable artistic environment.” As long as this compression is accurate and doesn't omit anything substantial, however, it's fine. And “the efforts of an entrepreneurial individual” clearly refers to Berry Gordy, Jr., while the “favorable artistic environment” could refer both to the public music-education programs in Detroit and the electric revolution in pop music.

Both of these words are strong action verbs. They are used to show that someone is acting boldly and without reservation. And in the first paragraph, the author claims he had a “belief” in his economic independence (P1, S3). All of these suggest that Gordy had “strong personal conviction” — a steadfast belief in and commitment to his vision. For these reasons, (D) is supported by the passage and is correct."

But this answer choice suffers from a similar problem as (C). Do you recall reading anything about “changing economic conditions”? An experienced test-taker would recognize that they don't remember any references to “economic conditions” and check the passage to see if any references were made to economic conditions. Better yet, such a test-taker would take their lack of familiarity as a sign that “economic conditions” was not discussed in this passage and eliminate this outright."

Gordy's entrepreneurial skills and his belief in economic independence played a great role in Motown's success, as did <lr data-itemid='16815-04'>the artistic situation</lr> in Detroit in the 1960s. Capitalizing on the rich musical talent of Detroit's African American community, Motown moved quickly into the vanguard of the popular music industry.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Motown's status as an independent company allowed Gordy considerable freedom to oppose recording industry convention. He rejected the practice that was common in the late 1950s and early 1960s of having established recording stars remake songs originally produced within and for limited markets. Gordy insisted that the musical performances recorded by Motown artists would appeal not just to African American audiences, but to a much wider market, and that there would thus be no need to engage high-priced major-label artists to produce alternate versions of Motown's songs. Gordy believed that maintaining the highest possible technical quality in Motown's recordings was an essential part of this appeal, and he devoted the necessary resources to this endeavor.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Another crucial factor in Motown's success was Detroit's well-developed public school music-education program, which provided the company with a deep and talented pool of artists and technicians. The roots of this program reached back to the turn of the century, when a trained soprano and Detroit native named E. Azalia Hackley adopted the musical education of African American youth as her personal mission. From Hackley's tutelage to that of locally renowned public school music teachers, Detroit's African American youth had been educated in a vibrant musical atmosphere. Nearly all of Motown's session musicians, arrangers, and producers were trained in this program. Moreover, many of the performers who would become famous exemplars of the Motown sound received musical training and exposure to diverse musical styles in Detroit schools. Motown's three major early groups—the Supremes, the Temptations, and the Miracles—came together and originally rehearsed at their high schools.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>In addition to Gordy's business acumen and the talent produced by the local school system, the invention and growing popularity of electric instruments also played a noteworthy role in Motown's rise to prominence. African American musicians were among the first to use the electric bass, for example, crafting a distinctive sound that inspired other musicians to experiment with this new musical technology. This experimentation ultimately led to a revolution in popular music, helping to broaden both its sound and its audience. In this way, too, Motown Records helped to initiate, and simultaneously benefited from, landmark shifts in popular music culture.</p>",

In the second paragraph, the author writes, “Motown's status as an independent company allowed Gordy considerable freedom to oppose recording industry convention” (P2, S1). So, the author thinks Motown's independence led to Gordy's freedom to defy convention. It stands to reason that if Motown lacked that freedom, it would have been harder for Gordy to deviate from standard practices in the record industry. Notably, this answer choice never claimed it would have been impossible for Gordy to do so. That claim would be difficult to support. But this weaker claim is well supported by the second paragraph, and this answer is correct."

Gordy insisted that the musical performances recorded by Motown artists would appeal not just to African American audiences, but to a much wider market, and that there would thus be no need to engage high-priced major-label artists to produce alternate versions of Motown's songs. Gordy believed that maintaining the highest possible technical quality in Motown's recordings was an essential part of this appeal, and he devoted the necessary resources to this endeavor.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Another crucial factor in Motown's success was Detroit's well-developed public school music-education program, which provided the company with a deep and talented pool of artists and technicians. The roots of this program reached back to the turn of the century, when a trained soprano and Detroit native named E. Azalia Hackley adopted the musical education of African American youth as her personal mission. From Hackley's tutelage to that of locally renowned public school music teachers, Detroit's African American youth had been educated in a vibrant musical atmosphere. Nearly all of Motown's session musicians, arrangers, and producers were trained in this program. Moreover, many of the performers who would become famous exemplars of the Motown sound received musical training and exposure to diverse musical styles in Detroit schools. Motown's three major early groups—the Supremes, the Temptations, and the Miracles—came together and originally rehearsed at their high schools.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>In addition to Gordy's business acumen and the talent produced by the local school system, the invention and growing popularity of electric instruments also played a noteworthy role in Motown's rise to prominence.

This experimentation ultimately led to a revolution in popular music, helping to broaden both its sound and its audience. In this way, too, Motown Records helped to initiate, and simultaneously benefited from, landmark shifts in popular music culture.</p>",

                        "stimulusText": "<p style='text-indent: 1em;'>In 1959, Hitsville, USA—the company better known as Motown Records—was founded in Detroit, Michigan by Berry Gordy, Jr. Several factors contributed to Motown's rapidly becoming one of the most successful record companies in the United States. Gordy's entrepreneurial skills and his belief in economic independence played a great role in Motown's success, as did <lr data-itemid='16815-04'>the artistic situation</lr> in Detroit in the 1960s. Capitalizing on the rich musical talent of Detroit's African American community, Motown moved quickly into the vanguard of the popular music industry.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Motown's status as an independent company allowed Gordy considerable freedom to oppose recording industry convention. He rejected the practice that was common in the late 1950s and early 1960s of having established recording stars remake songs originally produced within and for limited markets. Gordy insisted that the musical performances recorded by Motown artists would appeal not just to African American audiences, but to a much wider market, and that there would thus be no need to engage high-priced major-label artists to produce alternate versions of Motown's songs. Gordy believed that maintaining the highest possible technical quality in Motown's recordings was an essential part of this appeal, and he devoted the necessary resources to this endeavor.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Another crucial factor in Motown's success was Detroit's well-developed public school music-education program, which provided the company with a deep and talented pool of artists and technicians. The roots of this program reached back to the turn of the century, when a trained soprano and Detroit native named E. Azalia Hackley adopted the musical education of African American youth as her personal mission. From Hackley's tutelage to that of locally renowned public school music teachers, Detroit's African American youth had been educated in a vibrant musical atmosphere. Nearly all of Motown's session musicians, arrangers, and producers were trained in this program. Moreover, many of the performers who would become famous exemplars of the Motown sound received musical training and exposure to diverse musical styles in Detroit schools. Motown's three major early groups—the Supremes, the Temptations, and the Miracles—came together and originally rehearsed at their high schools.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>In addition to Gordy's business acumen and the talent produced by the local school system, the invention and growing popularity of electric instruments also played a noteworthy role in Motown's rise to prominence. African American musicians were among the first to use the electric bass, for example, crafting a distinctive sound that inspired other musicians to experiment with this new musical technology. This experimentation ultimately led to a revolution in popular music, helping to broaden both its sound and its audience. In this way, too, Motown Records helped to initiate, and simultaneously benefited from, landmark shifts in popular music culture.</p>",

In contrast to other information-gathering institutions, such as committees and polls, markets require participants to put hard dollars behind their opinions. What's more, markets reward people who are right, not those who lie convincingly or are loudest or most aggressive or who have the most degrees after their name.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Some markets have been engineered for the purpose of providing forecasts. For over a decade, an academic project called the Iowa Electronic Markets has predicted the outcomes of certain elections better than 75 percent of the polls did. Investors put money into a pool. If there are two candidates, each dollar invested purchases two contracts, one paying $1 if candidate A wins, and one paying $1 if candidate B wins. Participants can then buy and sell those contracts at a website. If the going rate for candidate A is 53 cents, then the market as a whole thinks candidate A has a 53 percent chance of winning.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Markets are highly \"efficient,\" in the sense that the market as a whole learns—lightning fast and very accurately—what informed people know. In one experiment, a dozen participants were permitted to trade a fictional stock, having been told that it was worth one of three possible amounts. Two of the participants were then told which amount had been selected, giving them \"inside knowledge.\" Participants couldn't communicate with each other; they could only buy and sell on the market. But everyone watched the movements of the market price, and within seconds, everyone was acting as if they were insiders.</p><p></p><p><em style='font-weight:bold; font-style:normal;'>Passage B</em></p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Markets are not infallible. To many people, this statement is a form of economic blasphemy. I suggest those people should get over it. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>In a recent election, the Iowa Electronic Markets had the eventual winner trading far lower than an opponent up until a few days before the event. For almost a solid year leading up to it, this market's \"prediction\" was that the opponent would win easily.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Think of markets as racetracks: you get paid lower odds the better the horse looks before a race. When the nag appears ill, old, or tired, the odds are highest, and buyers get the greatest potential payoff. When the steed starts to look healthier, the odds slide lower as a win starts looking more and more likely. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>If \"prediction markets\" do not actually predict the future, then what do they do? I suggest they merely reflect the majority opinion at a given moment. That does not imbue them with any special omniscience. Think of them as polls that avoid random spoofing because the polled must pay an entry fee to participate. That generates more serious responses than other polls—but the answers are just as potentially wrong as any other future guess. Like the majority, sometimes they are right, and sometimes they are wrong.</p>",

Yet answering the question of what constitutes a \"good\" species has long been a confusing and controversial exercise. Within ornithological circles, the debate over the \"species question\" has often been described as being between \"lumpers\" and \"splitters,\" between those who group separate but very similar populations of birds into a single species and those who divide such populations into full species. Generally, the lumpers employ what is known as the biological species concept, which until recently was the dominant approach to species classification. Its proponents define a species as a group that is reproductively isolated from other groups, which means that there is no substantial interbreeding in the wild between members of the groups. Splitters, on the other hand, tend to use the increasingly popular phylogenetic species concept, which defines a species as a \"diagnosable\" population, among which there is a pattern of ancestry and descent. A phylogenetic species is a population in which members share a distinctive, genetically traceable feature that distinguishes it from other populations.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The late Charles G. Sibley, a prominent ornithologist and one of the fomenters of a controversial revolution in avian taxonomy, could be called a splitter.

Within ornithological circles, the debate over the \"species question\" has often been described as being between \"lumpers\" and \"splitters,\" between those who group separate but very similar populations of birds into a single species and those who divide such populations into full species. Generally, the lumpers employ what is known as the biological species concept, which until recently was the dominant approach to species classification. Its proponents define a species as a group that is reproductively isolated from other groups, which means that there is no substantial interbreeding in the wild between members of the groups. Splitters, on the other hand, tend to use the increasingly popular phylogenetic species concept, which defines a species as a \"diagnosable\" population, among which there is a pattern of ancestry and descent.

Yet answering the question of what constitutes a \"good\" species has long been a confusing and controversial exercise. Within ornithological circles, the debate over the \"species question\" has often been described as being between \"lumpers\" and \"splitters,\" between those who group separate but very similar populations of birds into a single species and those who divide such populations into full species. Generally, the lumpers employ what is known as the biological species concept, which until recently was the dominant approach to species classification. Its proponents define a species as a group that is reproductively isolated from other groups, which means that there is no substantial interbreeding in the wild between members of the groups. Splitters, on the other hand, tend to use the increasingly popular phylogenetic species concept, which defines a species as a \"diagnosable\" population, among which there is a pattern of ancestry and descent. A phylogenetic species is a population in which members share a distinctive, genetically traceable feature that distinguishes it from other populations.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The late Charles G. Sibley, a prominent ornithologist and one of the fomenters of a controversial revolution in avian taxonomy, could be called a splitter. He used a process known as DNA-DNA hybridization—which compares DNA from different species—to determine the relationships of the various families of birds. <lr data-itemid='RL021-08'>From his studies he concluded that many earlier classifications of the relationships of bird families were wrong. For instance, he said that vultures found in North and South America were more closely related to storks than to European vultures, and that loons and grebes, which many taxonomists had argued were closely related, were not.</lr></p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Sibley's work has not been widely accepted. \"What the DNA data can give you is an approximation of how different the genes of two isolated populations are,\" one critic has written, \"but how you interpret those differences is basically arbitrary, as arbitrary as any decision made in any species concept.\" Sibley might not have disagreed, at least not entirely. In 1996 he wrote that \"Evolution produces all degrees of genetic differences between populations of organisms, but, for practical reasons, we must limit the number of degrees we choose to 'recognize' by names. We assign names of populations and proposed definitions of taxonomic categories based on various criteria, but the 'species concept' is slippery because there are so many examples in nature of populations that refuse to fit our limited set of definitions and names.\"</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Whatever the merits of each position, the species question undoubtedly has political and economic stakes. <lr data-itemid='RL021-13'>For example, increasing the number of species would probably increase the number needing protection as well.</lr></p>",

As described in the final paragraph of that section, let's assume the lumpers grouped the populations A, B, and C into one species, but none of populations A, B, or C were regarded as endangered. In that case, the lumpers wouldn't think the species as a whole needed protection. Even if the splitters came along and divided that species into three new species, none of the new species would need protection either. This answer choice fixes this issue by saying that the splitters wouldn't both reclassify the lumpers' A/B/C species. So the only times the splitters would reclassify species is when the species has one or more endangered populations. This would make it more likely that increasing the number of species through “splitting” would result in more species needing protection. Therefore, this strengthens the argument, and it is the correct answer."

Without a legal deterrent to copycat programming, the resources expended by an individual or a company to develop an innovative software program could be unfairly exploited by rivals who develop a similar product and rush it to market at a lower price. The occurrence of such exploitation would leave software developers with little financial incentive to develop innovative products. While most legal commentators agree that copyright has generally proven to be an effective means of preventing this exploitation, some contend that patent protection is also needed to combat copycatting.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>In essence, every piece of software is an encoding of one or more algorithms. An algorithm is simply defined as a series of steps to be followed in carrying out a task; to be usable in computer applications, an algorithm must be expressed in terms that can be processed by a computer. Proponents of software patents assert that in providing a specific way of achieving a desired result, the encoding of algorithms is analogous to the design of a process. Process designs (for example, an innovative way of inducing a series of chemical reactions) do, in fact, fall under the scope of patent protection. However, in order for any design to be patentable, it must be genuinely a product of invention (rather than, say, a law of nature or a logical axiom). For example, while a particular innovative windmill design might be patentable, the principle that wind can be harnessed to produce energy would clearly not be. On similar grounds, software algorithms, because they represent generic principles underlying the specific processes by which tasks are to be carried out by computers, should not be considered patentable.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Issuing patents for computer programs would extend protection to software developers beyond that afforded by copyright when there is really no compelling justification for doing so. Insofar as software programs constitute the expression of ideas in the form of specific texts (i.e., sequences of computer code), they fall more appropriately within the established domain of copyright law. Whereas patents protect the underlying design of an invention, even if it is never actually executed, copyright protects only the particular way in which the underlying ideas are expressed. Because the value of software lies in its form of expression, protection should be given only for particular applications—expressions of algorithms in an encoded form. Such protection could be more effectively afforded with only slight modification to existing copyright laws, and the financial incentive to develop innovative software could thereby be preserved.</p>",

Without a legal deterrent to copycat programming, the resources expended by an individual or a company to develop an innovative software program could be unfairly exploited by rivals who develop a similar product and rush it to market at a lower price. The occurrence of such exploitation would leave software developers with little financial incentive to develop innovative products. While most legal commentators agree that copyright has generally proven to be an effective means of preventing this exploitation, some contend that patent protection is also needed to combat copycatting.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>In essence, every piece of software is an encoding of one or more algorithms. An algorithm is simply defined as a series of steps to be followed in carrying out a task; to be usable in computer applications, an algorithm must be expressed in terms that can be processed by a computer. Proponents of software patents assert that in providing a specific way of achieving a desired result, the encoding of algorithms is analogous to the design of a process. Process designs (for example, an innovative way of inducing a series of chemical reactions) do, in fact, fall under the scope of patent protection. However, in order for any design to be patentable, it must be genuinely a product of invention (rather than, say, a law of nature or a logical axiom). For example, while a particular innovative windmill design might be patentable, the principle that wind can be harnessed to produce energy would clearly not be. On similar grounds, software algorithms, because they represent generic principles underlying the specific processes by which tasks are to be carried out by computers, should not be considered patentable.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Issuing patents for computer programs would extend protection to software developers beyond that afforded by copyright when there is really no compelling justification for doing so. Insofar as software programs constitute the expression of ideas in the form of specific texts (i.e., sequences of computer code), they fall more appropriately within the established domain of copyright law. Whereas patents protect the underlying design of an invention, even if it is never actually executed, copyright protects only the particular way in which the underlying ideas are expressed. Because the value of software lies in its form of expression, protection should be given only for particular applications—expressions of algorithms in an encoded form. Such protection could be more effectively afforded with only slight modification to existing copyright laws, and the financial incentive to develop innovative software could thereby be preserved.</p>",

Without a legal deterrent to copycat programming, the resources expended by an individual or a company to develop an innovative software program could be unfairly exploited by rivals who develop a similar product and rush it to market at a lower price. The occurrence of such exploitation would leave software developers with little financial incentive to develop innovative products. While most legal commentators agree that copyright has generally proven to be an effective means of preventing this exploitation, some contend that patent protection is also needed to combat copycatting.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>In essence, every piece of software is an encoding of one or more algorithms. An algorithm is simply defined as a series of steps to be followed in carrying out a task; to be usable in computer applications, an algorithm must be expressed in terms that can be processed by a computer. Proponents of software patents assert that in providing a specific way of achieving a desired result, the encoding of algorithms is analogous to the design of a process. Process designs (for example, an innovative way of inducing a series of chemical reactions) do, in fact, fall under the scope of patent protection. However, in order for any design to be patentable, it must be genuinely a product of invention (rather than, say, a law of nature or a logical axiom). For example, while a particular innovative windmill design might be patentable, the principle that wind can be harnessed to produce energy would clearly not be. On similar grounds, software algorithms, because they represent generic principles underlying the specific processes by which tasks are to be carried out by computers, should not be considered patentable.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Issuing patents for computer programs would extend protection to software developers beyond that afforded by copyright when there is really no compelling justification for doing so. Insofar as software programs constitute the expression of ideas in the form of specific texts (i.e., sequences of computer code), they fall more appropriately within the established domain of copyright law. Whereas patents protect the underlying design of an invention, even if it is never actually executed, copyright protects only the particular way in which the underlying ideas are expressed. Because the value of software lies in its form of expression, protection should be given only for particular applications—expressions of algorithms in an encoded form. Such protection could be more effectively afforded with only slight modification to existing copyright laws, and the financial incentive to develop innovative software could thereby be preserved.</p>",

In supporting the main point, the author claims that copyright law protects the way ideas are expressed, while patent law protects the ideas as long as they are a product of the invention (P3, S3). These are two different things, so qualifying for patent protection is not sufficient to also qualify for copyright protection."

The author concludes that the algorithms should not receive protection under patent law, so we don't have any reason to think that algorithms are so protected that they can't be used in multiple software programs without permission. This is another one we can eliminate."

However, this is a fairly bold assertion and is consequently quite hard to support. Moreover, most test-takers will probably not remember any references to the prevalence of “illegally copycatted computer code.” Indeed, this was not a topic the author addressed, and this answer choice is incorrect."
