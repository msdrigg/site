In this case, we could conclude that stars are *not* more than a million miles from Earth (because they do appear in the same position each night). Does this undermine the conclusion? Not at all!

                        "stimulusText": "<p style='text-indent: 1em;'>African American painter Sam Gilliam (b. 1933) is internationally recognized as one of the foremost painters associated with the Washington Color School, a group of Color Field style painters practicing in Washington, D.C. during the 1950s and 1960s. The Color Field style was an important development in abstract art that emerged after the rise of abstract expressionism. It evolved from complex and minimally representational abstractions in the 1950s to totally nonrepresentational, simplified works of bright colors in the 1960s.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Gilliam's participation in the Color Field movement was motivated in part by his reaction to the art of his African American contemporaries, much of which was strictly representational and was intended to convey explicit political statements. Gilliam found their approach to be aesthetically conservative: the message was unmistakable, he felt, and there was little room for the expression of subtlety or ambiguity or, more importantly, the exploration of new artistic territory through experimentation and innovation. For example, one of his contemporaries worked with collage, assembling disparate bits of images from popular magazines into loosely structured compositions that depicted the period's political issues—themes such as urban life, the rural South, and African American music. Though such art was quite popular with the general public, Gilliam was impatient with its straightforward, literal approach to representation. In its place he sought an artistic form that was more expressive than a painted figure or a political slogan, more evocative of the complexity of human experience in general, and of the African American experience in particular. In this he represented a view that was then rare among African American artists.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Gilliam's highly experimental paintings epitomized his refusal to conform to the public's expectation that African American artists produce explicitly political art. His early experiments included pouring paint onto stained canvases and folding canvases over onto themselves. Then around 1965 Gilliam became the first painter to introduce the idea of the unsupported canvas. Partially inspired by the sight of neighbors hanging laundry on clotheslines, Gilliam began to drape huge pieces of loose canvas along floors and fold them up and down walls, even suspending them from ceilings, giving them a third dimension and therefore a sculptural quality. These efforts demonstrate a sensitivity to the texture of daily experience, as well as the ability to generate tension by juxtaposing conceptual opposites—such as surface and depth or chaos and control—to form a cohesive whole. In this way, Gilliam helped advance the notion that the deepest, hardest-to-capture emotions and tensions of being African American could not be represented directly, but were expressed more effectively through the creation of moods that would allow these emotions and tensions to be felt by all audiences.</p>",

The Color Field style was an important development in abstract art that emerged after the rise of abstract expressionism. It evolved from complex and minimally representational abstractions in the 1950s to totally nonrepresentational, simplified works of bright colors in the 1960s.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Gilliam's participation in the Color Field movement was motivated in part by his reaction to the art of his African American contemporaries, much of which was strictly representational and was intended to convey explicit political statements. Gilliam found their approach to be aesthetically conservative: the message was unmistakable, he felt, and there was little room for the expression of subtlety or ambiguity or, more importantly, the exploration of new artistic territory through experimentation and innovation. For example, one of his contemporaries worked with collage, assembling disparate bits of images from popular magazines into loosely structured compositions that depicted the period's political issues—themes such as urban life, the rural South, and African American music. Though such art was quite popular with the general public, Gilliam was impatient with its straightforward, literal approach to representation. In its place he sought an artistic form that was more expressive than a painted figure or a political slogan, more evocative of the complexity of human experience in general, and of the African American experience in particular. In this he represented a view that was then rare among African American artists.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Gilliam's highly experimental paintings epitomized his refusal to conform to the public's expectation that African American artists produce explicitly political art. His early experiments included pouring paint onto stained canvases and folding canvases over onto themselves. Then around 1965 Gilliam became the first painter to introduce the idea of the unsupported canvas. Partially inspired by the sight of neighbors hanging laundry on clotheslines, Gilliam began to drape huge pieces of loose canvas along floors and fold them up and down walls, even suspending them from ceilings, giving them a third dimension and therefore a sculptural quality. These efforts demonstrate a sensitivity to the texture of daily experience, as well as the ability to generate tension by juxtaposing conceptual opposites—such as surface and depth or chaos and control—to form a cohesive whole. In this way, Gilliam helped advance the notion that the deepest, hardest-to-capture emotions and tensions of being African American could not be represented directly, but were expressed more effectively through the creation of moods that would allow these emotions and tensions to be felt by all audiences.</p>",

They each pick, say, a medieval character to play, such as a warrior. Then they might band together in quests to slay magical beasts; their avatars appear as tiny characters striding across a Tolkienesque land.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The economist Edward Castronova noticed something curious about the game he played: it had its own economy, a bustling trade in virtual goods. Players generate goods as they play, often by killing creatures for their treasure and trading it. The longer they play, the wealthier they get.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Things got even more interesting when Castronova learned about the \"player auctions.\" Players would sometimes tire of the game and decide to sell off their virtual possessions at online auction sites.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>As Castronova stared at the auction listings, he recognized with a shock what he was looking at. It was a form of currency trading! Each item had a value in the virtual currency traded in the game; when it was sold on the auction site, someone was paying cold hard cash for it. That meant that the virtual currency was worth something in real currency. Moreover, since players were killing monsters or <lr data-itemid='RQ013-03'>skinning animals</lr> to sell their pelts, they were, in effect, creating wealth.</p><p></p><p><em style='font-weight: bold; font-style:normal;'>Passage B</em></p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Most multiplayer online games prohibit real-world trade in virtual items, but some actually encourage it, for example, by granting participants intellectual property rights in their creations.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Although it seems intuitively the case that someone who accepts real money for the transfer of a virtual item should be taxed, what about the player who only accumulates items or virtual currency within a virtual world? Is \"loot\" acquired in a game taxable, as a prize or award is? And is the profit in a purely in-game trade or sale for virtual currency taxable? These are important questions, given the tax revenues at stake, and there is pressure on governments to answer them, given that the economies of some virtual worlds are comparable to those of small countries. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Most people's intuition probably would be that accumulation of assets within a game should not be taxed even though income tax applies even to noncash accessions to wealth. This article will argue that income tax law and policy support that result. Loot acquisitions in game worlds should not be treated as taxable prizes and awards, but rather should be treated like other property that requires effort to obtain, such as <lr data-itemid='RQ013-03'>fish pulled from the ocean</lr>, which is taxed only upon sale. Moreover, in-game trades of virtual items should not be treated as taxable barter.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>By contrast, tax doctrine and policy counsel taxation of the sale of virtual items for real currency, and, in <lr data-itemid='RQ013-07'>games that are intentionally commodified</lr>, even of in-world sales for virtual currency, regardless of whether the participant cashes out. This approach would leave entertainment value untaxed without creating a tax shelter for virtual commerce.</p>",

Certain psychologists have supported this view with data concerning the performance of prodigies and the apparent heritability of relevant traits. They have noted, for example, that most outstanding musicians are discovered by the age of six, and they have found evidence that some of the qualities necessary for exceptional athletic performance, including superior motor coordination, speed of reflexes, and hand-eye coordination, can be inborn.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Until recently, however, little systematic research was done on the topic of superior performance, and previous estimates of the heritability of traits relevant to performance were based almost exclusively on random samples of the general population rather than on studies of highly trained superior performers as compared with the general population. Recent research in different domains of excellence suggests that exceptional performance arises predominantly from acquired complex skills and physiological adaptations, rather than from innate abilities. For example, it has been found that the most accomplished athletes show a systematic advantage in reaction time or perceptual discrimination only in their particular fields of performance, not in more general laboratory tests for these factors. Similarly, superior chess players have exceptional memory for configurations of chess pieces, but only if those configurations are typical of chess games.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The vast majority of exceptional adult performers were not exceptional as children, but started instruction early and improved their performance through sustained high-level training. Only extremely rarely is outstanding performance achieved without at least ten years of intensive, deliberate practice. With such intensive training, chess players who may not have superior innate capacities can acquire skills that circumvent basic limits on such factors as memory and the ability to process information. Recent research shows that, with the clear exception of some traits such as height, a surprisingly large number of anatomical characteristics, including aerobic capacity and the percentage of muscle fibers, show specific changes that develop from extended intense training. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The evidence does not, therefore, support the claim that a notion of innate talent must be invoked in order to account for the difference between good and outstanding performance, since it suggests instead that extended intense training, together with that level of talent common to all reasonably competent performers, may suffice to account for this difference. Since sustained intense training usually depends on an appropriate level of interest and desire, and since those who eventually become superior performers more often show early signs of exceptional interest than early evidence of unusual ability, motivational factors are more likely to be effective predictors of superior performance than is innate talent.</p>",

The first paragraph lays out the traditional view—that some notion of innate talent must account for the highest level of performance in any activity. The second paragraph asserts the passage’s thesis: new research shows that exceptional performance actually comes from acquired skills and adaptations. The third paragraph expounds upon this claim, explaining that most exceptional performers got to be exceptional via years of intense training and practice, through which they acquired these skills and adaptations. And the last paragraph concludes that the evidence supports the thesis, briefly mentioning some new implications about the predictors for superior performance."

Certain psychologists have supported this view with data concerning the performance of prodigies and the apparent heritability of relevant traits.

Recent research in different domains of excellence suggests that exceptional performance arises predominantly from acquired complex skills and physiological adaptations, rather than from innate abilities. For example, it has been found that the most accomplished athletes show a systematic advantage in reaction time or perceptual discrimination only in their particular fields of performance, not in more general laboratory tests for these factors.

Certain psychologists have supported this view with data concerning the performance of prodigies and the apparent heritability of relevant traits. They have noted, for example, that most outstanding musicians are discovered by the age of six, and they have found evidence that some of the qualities necessary for exceptional athletic performance, including superior motor coordination, speed of reflexes, and hand-eye coordination, can be inborn.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Until recently, however, little systematic research was done on the topic of superior performance, and previous estimates of the heritability of traits relevant to performance were based almost exclusively on random samples of the general population rather than on studies of highly trained superior performers as compared with the general population. Recent research in different domains of excellence suggests that exceptional performance arises predominantly from acquired complex skills and physiological adaptations, rather than from innate abilities. For example, it has been found that the most accomplished athletes show a systematic advantage in reaction time or perceptual discrimination only in their particular fields of performance, not in more general laboratory tests for these factors. Similarly, superior chess players have exceptional memory for configurations of chess pieces, but only if those configurations are typical of chess games.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The vast majority of exceptional adult performers were not exceptional as children, but started instruction early and improved their performance through sustained high-level training. Only extremely rarely is outstanding performance achieved without at least ten years of intensive, deliberate practice. With such intensive training, chess players who may not have superior innate capacities can acquire skills that circumvent basic limits on such factors as memory and the ability to process information. Recent research shows that, with the clear exception of some traits such as height, a surprisingly large number of anatomical characteristics, including aerobic capacity and the percentage of muscle fibers, show specific changes that develop from extended intense training. </p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>The evidence does not, therefore, support the claim that a notion of innate talent must be invoked in order to account for the difference between good and outstanding performance, since it suggests instead that extended intense training, together with that level of talent common to all reasonably competent performers, may suffice to account for this difference. Since sustained intense training usually depends on an appropriate level of interest and desire, and since those who eventually become superior performers more often show early signs of exceptional interest than early evidence of unusual ability, motivational factors are more likely to be effective predictors of superior performance than is innate talent.</p>",

                        "stimulusText": "<p style='text-indent: 1em;'>Physicists are often asked why the image of an object, such as a chair, appears reversed left-to-right rather than, say, top-to-bottom when viewed in a mirror. Their answer is simply that an image viewed in a mirror appears reversed about the axis around which the viewer rotates his or her field of sight in turning from the object to its reflected image. That is, the reversal in question is relative to the position and orientation of the observer when the object is viewed directly. Since we ordinarily rotate our field of sight about a vertical axis, mirror images usually appear reversed left-to-right. This is the field-of-sight explanation.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>However, some physicists offer a completely different explanation of what mirrors \"do,\" suggesting that mirrors actually reverse things front-to-back. If we place a chair in front of a mirror we can envision how its reflected image will appear by imagining another chair in the space \"inside\" the mirror. The resulting reflection is identical to, and directly facing, the original chair. The most notable thing about this explanation is that it is clearly based on a false premise: the chair \"inside\" the mirror is not real, yet the explanation treats it as though it were as real and three dimensional as the original chair.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>This explanation appeals strongly to many people, however, because it is quite successful at explaining what a mirror does—to a point. It seems natural because we are accustomed to dealing with our mental constructs of objects rather than with the primary sense perceptions on which those constructs are based. In general, we can safely presume a fairly reliable equation between our perceptions and their associated mental constructs, but mirrors are an exception. They present us with sense perceptions that we naturally construe in a way that is contrary to fact. Indeed, mirrors are \"designed\" to make a two-dimensional surface appear to have depth. Note, for example, that <lr data-itemid='16818-06'>mirrors are among the few objects on which we almost never focus our eyes</lr>; rather, we look into them, with our focal lengths adjusted into the imagined space.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>In addition to its intuitive appeal, the front-to-back explanation is motivated in part by the traditional desire in science to separate the observer from the phenomenon. Scientists like to think that what mirrors do should be explainable without reference to what the observer does (e.g., rotating a field of sight). However, questions about the appearances of images can be properly answered only if we consider both what mirrors do and what happens when we look into mirrors. If we remove the observer from consideration, we are no longer addressing images and appearances, because an image entails an observer and a point of view.</p>",

Their answer is simply that an image viewed in a mirror appears reversed about the axis around which the viewer rotates his or her field of sight in turning from the object to its reflected image. That is, the reversal in question is relative to the position and orientation of the observer when the object is viewed directly. Since we ordinarily rotate our field of sight about a vertical axis, mirror images usually appear reversed left-to-right. This is the field-of-sight explanation.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>However, some physicists offer a completely different explanation of what mirrors \"do,\" suggesting that mirrors actually reverse things front-to-back. If we place a chair in front of a mirror we can envision how its reflected image will appear by imagining another chair in the space \"inside\" the mirror. The resulting reflection is identical to, and directly facing, the original chair. The most notable thing about this explanation is that it is clearly based on a false premise: the chair \"inside\" the mirror is not real, yet the explanation treats it as though it were as real and three dimensional as the original chair.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>This explanation appeals strongly to many people, however, because it is quite successful at explaining what a mirror does—to a point. It seems natural because we are accustomed to dealing with our mental constructs of objects rather than with the primary sense perceptions on which those constructs are based. In general, we can safely presume a fairly reliable equation between our perceptions and their associated mental constructs, but mirrors are an exception. They present us with sense perceptions that we naturally construe in a way that is contrary to fact. Indeed, mirrors are \"designed\" to make a two-dimensional surface appear to have depth. Note, for example, that <lr data-itemid='16818-06'>mirrors are among the few objects on which we almost never focus our eyes</lr>; rather, we look into them, with our focal lengths adjusted into the imagined space.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>In addition to its intuitive appeal, the front-to-back explanation is motivated in part by the traditional desire in science to separate the observer from the phenomenon. Scientists like to think that what mirrors do should be explainable without reference to what the observer does (e.g., rotating a field of sight). However, questions about the appearances of images can be properly answered only if we consider both what mirrors do and what happens when we look into mirrors. If we remove the observer from consideration, we are no longer addressing images and appearances, because an image entails an observer and a point of view.</p>",

The author tells us that there is a traditional motivation in science to separate the observer from the phenomenon, and that this is partially why the front-to-back theory is so appealing.

In other words, if we remove the observer, “we are no longer addressing images and appearances, because an image entails an observer and a point of view.”"

Their answer is simply that an image viewed in a mirror appears reversed about the axis around which the viewer rotates his or her field of sight in turning from the object to its reflected image. That is, the reversal in question is relative to the position and orientation of the observer when the object is viewed directly. Since we ordinarily rotate our field of sight about a vertical axis, mirror images usually appear reversed left-to-right. This is the field-of-sight explanation.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>However, some physicists offer a completely different explanation of what mirrors \"do,\" suggesting that mirrors actually reverse things front-to-back. If we place a chair in front of a mirror we can envision how its reflected image will appear by imagining another chair in the space \"inside\" the mirror. The resulting reflection is identical to, and directly facing, the original chair. The most notable thing about this explanation is that it is clearly based on a false premise: the chair \"inside\" the mirror is not real, yet the explanation treats it as though it were as real and three dimensional as the original chair.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>This explanation appeals strongly to many people, however, because it is quite successful at explaining what a mirror does—to a point. It seems natural because we are accustomed to dealing with our mental constructs of objects rather than with the primary sense perceptions on which those constructs are based. In general, we can safely presume a fairly reliable equation between our perceptions and their associated mental constructs, but mirrors are an exception. They present us with sense perceptions that we naturally construe in a way that is contrary to fact. Indeed, mirrors are \"designed\" to make a two-dimensional surface appear to have depth. Note, for example, that <lr data-itemid='16818-06'>mirrors are among the few objects on which we almost never focus our eyes</lr>; rather, we look into them, with our focal lengths adjusted into the imagined space.</p><p style='text-indent: 1em;'>In addition to its intuitive appeal, the front-to-back explanation is motivated in part by the traditional desire in science to separate the observer from the phenomenon. Scientists like to think that what mirrors do should be explainable without reference to what the observer does (e.g., rotating a field of sight). However, questions about the appearances of images can be properly answered only if we consider both what mirrors do and what happens when we look into mirrors. If we remove the observer from consideration, we are no longer addressing images and appearances, because an image entails an observer and a point of view.</p>",
