<p className="print:hidden">
I created LSAT Warthog to render the LSAT tests available on LawHub as HTML to allow easy PDF printing and on-paper test prep.
</p>

<p className="print:hidden">
I have pre-loaded the free LSAT tests from the site, so you can select from `140`, `141`, `157`, and `158` in the dropdown below. If you want to render a different test, you will need to download the JSON data for that test from your own lawhub account and paste it into the text area yourself.
