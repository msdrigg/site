Roam is a Roku TV remote that works for every single iOS device, but really shines on macOS.

With Roam, I have tried to integrate deeply into the apple ecosystem, with support for keyboard shortcuts on macOS, hardware volume buttons on iOS, widgets, shortcuts and siri integration for quick access. I'm even hoping to get an app clip working soon!

## Why I built this remote

I built Roam because every other Roku remote I tried on macOS was either feature incomplete or required in-app purchases.

## Features

-   Runs on Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Vision Pro or Apple TV!
-   Smart platform integration with keyboard shortcuts on Mac, using hardware volume buttons to control TV Volume on iOS
-   Use shortcuts and widgets to control your TV without ever opening the app!
-   Headphones mode (a.k.a. private listening) support on Mac, iPad, iPhone, VisionOS, and Apple TV (play the audio from your TV through your device)
-   Discover devices on your local network as soon as you open the app
-   Fast and lightweight, less than 5 MB on all devices and opens in less than half a second!
-   Open source (https://github.com/msdrigg/roam)
-   Intuitive design with apple's native SwiftUI design system
