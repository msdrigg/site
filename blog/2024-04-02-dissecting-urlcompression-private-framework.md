:::warning
Work in progress
:::

-   Explain the options to generate these codes:
    -   Use MacOS-only cli application to generate locally
    -   Call app store connect API with a token to generate the codes
-   Explain the URLCompression framework
    -   Little-to-no reverse engineering
    -   Only a couple of tweets from a few dudes
    -   No documentation
    -   Reverse engineering the framework in Ghidra :/
-   Explain my newfound interest due to apple pay using app clip codes
    -   Why aren't they recognized on the device?
        -   Could they be using v2 or just not using an encoded URL?
    -   No apple pay docs on the codes. Could I somehow use the URLCompression framework to reverse engineer these codes to see what URL they were hitting?
    -   Unfortunately no in-browser app clip code generation or scanning. The whole code SVG is sent over the wire to the device
